      My Dear Punch,
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a thousand and one reasons why I should dedicate this book to
      you. It would take a very long time and much good paper to give you them
      all; but here, at any rate, is one of them. Do you remember a summer day
      last year that we spent together? The place was a little French town, and
      we climbed its high, crooked street, and had tea in an inn at the top&mdash;an
      inn with a square courtyard, bad, impossible tea, and a large black cat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on that afternoon that I introduced you for a little time to Mr.
      Perrin, and you, because you have more understanding and sympathy than
      anyone I have ever met, understood him and sympathized. For the good
      things that you have done for me I can never repay you, but for the good
      things that you did on that afternoon for Mr. Perrin I give you this book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours affectionately,
    </p>

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">V</span>INCENT PERRIN said
      to himself again and again as he climbed the hill: &ldquo;It shall be all
      right this term&rdquo;&mdash;and then, &ldquo;It <i>shall</i> be&rdquo;&mdash;and
      then, &ldquo;<i>This</i> term.&rdquo; A cold wintry sun watched him from
      above the brown shaggy wood on the horizon; the sky was a pale and watery
      blue, and on its surface white clouds edged with gray lay like saucers. A
      little wind sighed and struggled amongst the hedges, because Mr Perrin had
      nearly reached the top of the hill, and there was always a breeze there.
      He stopped for a moment and looked back. The hill on which he was stood
      straight out from the surrounding country; it was shaped like a
      sugar-loaf, and the red-brown earth of its fields seemed to catch the red
      light of the sun; behind it was green, undulating country, in front of it
      the blue, vast sweep of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>shall</i> be all right this term,&rdquo; said Mr. Perrin, and
      he pulled his rather faded greatcoat about his ears, because the little
      wind was playing with the short bristly hairs at the back of his neck. He
      was long and gaunt; his face might have been considered strong had it not
      been for the weak chin and a shaggy, unkempt mustache of a nondescript
      pale brown. His hands were long and bony, and the collar that he wore was
      too high, and propped his neck up, so that he had the effect of someone
      who strained to overlook something. His eyes were pale and watery, and his
      eyebrows of the same sandy color as his mustache. His age was about
      forty-five, and he had been a master at Moffatt's for over twenty
      years. His back was a little bent as he walked; his hands were folded
      behind his back, and carried a rough, ugly walking-stick that trailed
      along the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were fixed on the enormous brown block of buildings on the top of
      the hill in front of him: he did not see the sea, or the sky, or the
      distant Brown Wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was still with the clear suspense of an early autumn day. The
      sound of a distant mining stamp drove across space with the ring of a
      hammer, and the tiny whisper&mdash;as of someone who tells eagerly, but
      mysteriously, a secret&mdash;was the beating of the waves far at the
      bottom of the hill against the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paint blue smoke hung against the saucer-shaped clouds above the chimneys
      of Moffatt's; in the air there was a sharp scented smell, of some
      hidden bonfire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence was broken by the sound of wheels, and an open cab drove up
      the hill. In it were seated four small boys, surrounded by a multitude of
      bags, hockey-sticks, and rugs. The four small boys were all very small
      indeed, but they all sat up when they saw Mr. Perrin, and touched their
      hats with a simultaneous movement. Mr. Perrin nodded sternly, glanced at
      them for a moment, and then switched his eyes back to the brown buildings
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barker Minor, French, Doggett, and Rogers.&rdquo; he said to
      himself quickly; &ldquo;Barker Minor, French.. . ;&rdquo; then his mind
      swung back to its earlier theme again, and he said out loud, hitting the
      road with his stick, &ldquo;It shall <i>be</i> all right <i>this</i> term.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The school clock&mdash;he knew the sound so well that he often thought he
      heard it at home in Buckinghamshire&mdash;struck half-past three. He
      hastened his steps. His holidays had been good&mdash;better than usual; he
      had played golf well; the men at the Club had not been quite such idiots
      and fools as they usually were: they had listened to him quite patiently
      about Education&mdash;shall it be Greek or German? Public School Morality,
      and What a Mother can do for her Boy&mdash;all favorite subjects of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps this term was not going to be so bad&mdash;perhaps the new man
      would be an acquisition: he could not, at any rate, be <i>worse</i> than
      Searle of the preceding term. The new man was, Perrin had heard, only just
      down from the University&mdash;he would probably do what Perrin suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, this term was to be all right. He never liked the autumn term; but
      there were a great many new boys, his house was full, and then&mdash;he
      stopped once more and drew a deep breath&mdash;there was Miss Desart. He
      tried to twist the end of his mustache, but some hairs were longer than
      others, and he never could obtain a combined movement.... Miss Desart....
      He coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed in through the black school gates, his shabby coat flapping at
      his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distant Brown Wood, as it surrendered to the sun, flamed with gold;
      the dark green hedges on the hill slowly caught the light.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The master's common room in the Lower School was a small square room
      that was inclined in the summer to get very stuffy indeed. It stood,
      moreover, exactly between the kitchen, where meals were prepared, and the
      long dining-room, where meals were eaten, and there was therefore a
      perpetual odor of food in the air. On a &ldquo;mutton day&rdquo;&mdash;there
      were three &ldquo;mutton&rdquo; days a week&mdash;this odor hung in heavy,
      clammy folds about the ceiling, and on those days there were always more
      boys kept in than on the other days&mdash;on so small a thing may
      punishment hang.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day&mdash;this being the first day of the term&mdash;-the room was
      exceedingly tidy. On the right wall, touching the windows, were two rows
      of pigeon-holes, and above each pigeon-hole was printed, on a white label,
      a name&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Perrin,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Dormer,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Clinton,&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Traill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Each master had two pigeon-holes into which he might put his papers and
      his letters; considerable friction had been caused by people putting <i>their</i>
      papers into other people's pigeon-holes. On the opposite wall was an
      enormous, shiny map of the world, with strange blue and red lines running
      across it. The third wall was filled with the fireplace, over which were
      two stern and dusty photographs of the Parthenon, Athens, and St. Peter's,
      Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the air was sharp with the first early hint of autumn, the
      windows were open, and a little part of the garden could be seen&mdash;a
      gravel path down which golden-brown leaves were fluttering, a round empty
      flower-bed, a stone wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the large table in the middle of the room tea was laid, one plate of
      bread and butter, and a plate of rock buns. Dormer, a round, red-faced,
      cheerful-looking person with white hair, aged about fifty, and Clinton, a
      short, athletic youth, with close-cropped hair and a large mouth, were
      drinking tea. Clinton had poured his into his saucer and was blowing at it&mdash;a
      practice that Perrin greatly disliked.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, this was the first day of term, and everyone was very friendly.
      Perrin paused a moment in the doorway. &ldquo;Ah! here we are again!&rdquo;
      he said, with easy jocularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dormer gave him a hand, and said, &ldquo;Glad to see you, Perrin; had good
      holidays?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clinton took the last rock bun, and shouted with a kind of roar, &ldquo;You
      old nut!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin, as he moved to the table, thought that it was a little hard that
      all the things that irritated him most should happen just when he was most
      inclined to be easy and pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! no cake!&rdquo; he said, with a surprised air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I say, I'm so sorry,&rdquo; said Clinton, with his mouth
      full, &ldquo;I took the last. Ring the bell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin gulped down his annoyance, sat down, and poured out his tea. It was
      cold and leathery. Dormer was busily writing lists of names. The Lower
      School was divided into two houses&mdash;Dormer was house-master of one,
      and Perrin of the other. The other two junior men were under
      house-masters: Clinton belonged to Dormer; and Traill, the new man, to
      Perrin. Both houses were in the same building, but the sense of rival
      camps gave a pleasant spur of emulation and competition both to work and
      play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Perrin, &ldquo;have you made out your bath-lists? Then there
      are locker-names&mdash;I want.&rdquo; Perrin snapped at his bread and
      butter. &ldquo;Ah, Dormer, please&mdash;my tea first.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; only, it's getting on to four.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For some moments there was silence. Then there came timid raps on the
      door. Perrin, in his most stentorian voice, shouted, &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door slowly opened, and there might be seen dimly in the passage a
      misty cloud of white Eton collars and round, white faces. There was a
      shuffling of feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin walked slowly to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we all are again! How pleasant! How extremely pleasant! All of
      us eager to come back, of course&mdash;um&mdash;yes. Well, you know you
      oughtn't to come now. Two minutes past four. I 'll take your
      names then&mdash;another five minutes. It's up on the board. Well,
      Sexton? Hadn't you eyes? <i>Don't</i> you know that ten
      minutes past four is ten minutes past four and <i>not</i> four o'clock?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, please, sir&mdash;but, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin closed the door, and walked slowly back to the fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha,&rdquo; he said, smiling reflectively; &ldquo;had him there!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dormer was muttering to himself, &ldquo;Wednesday, 9 o'clock, Bilto,
      Cummin; 10 o'clock, Sayer, Long. Thursday, 9 o'clock&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The golden leaves blew with a whispering chatter down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened again, and someone came in&mdash;Traill, the new man.
      Perrin looked at him with curiosity and some excitement. The first
      impression of him, standing there in the doorway, was of someone very
      young and very eager to make friends. Someone young, by reason of his very
      dress&mdash;the dark brown Norfolk jacket, light gray flannel trousers,
      turned up and short, showing bright purple socks and brown brogues. His
      hair, parted in the middle and brushed back, was very light brown; his
      eyes were brown and his cheeks tanned. His figure was square, his back
      very broad, his legs rather short&mdash;he looked, beyond everything else,
      tremendously clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped when he saw Perrin, and Dormer looked up and introduced them.
      Perrin was relieved that he was so young. Searle, last year, had been old
      enough to have an opinion of his own&mdash;several opinions of his own; he
      had contradicted Perrin on a great many points, and towards the end of the
      term they had scarcely been on speaking terms. Searle was a pig-headed
      ass....
    </p>
    <p>
      But Traill evidently wanted to &ldquo;know&rdquo;&mdash;was quite humble
      about it, and sat, pulling at his pipe, whilst Perrin enlarged about lists
      and dormitories and marks and discipline to his hearts content. &ldquo;I
      must say as far as order goes I 've never found any trouble. It
      's <i>in</i> a man if he 's going to do it&mdash;I've
      always managed them all right&mdash;never any trouble&mdash;hum, ha! Yes,
      you 'll find them the first few days just a little restive&mdash;seeing
      what you 're made of, you know; drop on them, drop on them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill asked about the holiday task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Dormer set that. <i>Ivanhoe</i>&mdash;Scott, you know.
      Just got to read out the questions, and see they don't crib. Let
      them go when you hear the chapel bell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill was profuse in his thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all&mdash;anything you want to know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, once again, the timid knock at the door. The door was opened,
      and a crowd of tiny boys shuffled in, headed by a larger boy who had the
      bold look of one who has lost all terror of masters, their ways, and their
      common rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sexton?&rdquo; Perrin cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, sir, you told me to bring the new boys. These are all I
      could find, sir&mdash;Pippin Minor is crying in the matron's room,
      sir.&rdquo; Sexton backed out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin stared at the agitated crowd for some moments without saying
      anything. The boys were herded together like cattle, and were staring at
      him with eyes that started from their round, close-cropped heads. Perrin
      took their names down. Then he talked to them for three minutes about
      discipline, decency, and decorum; then he reminded them of their mothers,
      and finally said a word about serving their country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he passed on to the subject of pocket-money. &ldquo;It will be safer
      for you to hand it over to me,&rdquo; he said slowly and impressively.
      &ldquo;Then you shall have it when you want it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight shiver of apprehension passed through the crowd; then slowly, one
      by one, they delivered up their shining silver. One tiny boy&mdash;he had
      apparently no neck and no legs; he was very chubby&mdash;had only two
      halfcrowns. He clutched these in his hot palm until Perrin said, &ldquo;Well,
      Rackets?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with eyes fixed devouringly upon them, the boy delivered them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like to see you so fond of money, Rackets.&rdquo;
      Perrin dropped the half-crowns slowly into his trouser pocket, one after
      the other. &ldquo;I don't think you will ever see these half-crowns
      again.&rdquo; He smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rackets began to choke. His fist, which had closed again as though the
      money was still there, moved forward. A large, fat tear gathered slowly in
      his eye. He struggled to keep it back&mdash;he dug his fist into it,
      turned round, and fled from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin was amused. &ldquo;Caught friend Rackets on the hip,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly, in the distance, an iron bell began to clang. The four men
      put on their gowns, gathered books together, and moved to the door. Traill
      hung back a little. &ldquo;You take the big room with me, Traill,&rdquo;
      said Dormer. &ldquo;I 'll give you paper and blotting-paper.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They moved slowly out of the room, Perrin last. A door was opened. There
      was a sudden cessation of confused whispers&mdash;complete silence, and
      then Perrin's voice: &ldquo;Question one. Who were Richard I.,
      Gurth, Wamba, Brian-de-Bois-Guilbert?.. . B,r,i,a,n&mdash;hyphen...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door closed.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A few papers fluttered about the table. It was growing dark outside, and a
      silver moon showed above the dark mass of the garden wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brown leaves, now invisible, passed rustling and whispering about the
      path. Into the room there stole softly, from the kitchen, the smell of
      onions....

      CHAPTER II&mdash;INTRODUCES A CONFUSING COMPANY OF PERSONS, WITH SPECIAL
      EMPHASIS ON MRS. COMBER
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T would be fitting
      at this moment, were it possible, to give Traill's impressions, at
      the end of the first week, of the place and the people. But here one is
      met by the outstanding and dominating difficulty that Traill himself was
      not given to gathering impressions at all&mdash;he felt things, but he
      never saw them; he recorded opinions in simple language and an abbreviated
      vocabulary, but it was all entirely objective; motives, the way that
      things hung and were interdependent one upon the other, the sense of
      contrast and of the incessant jostling of comedy on tragedy and of irony
      upon both, never hit him anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he had, in a clear, clean-cut way, his opinions at the end
      of the first week.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a letter of his to a college friend that is interesting, and
      there are some other things in a letter to his mother; but he was engaged,
      quite naturally, in endeavoring to keep up with the confusing medley of
      &ldquo;things to be done and things not to be done&rdquo; that that first
      week must necessarily entail.
    </p>
    <p>
      His relations to Perrin and Perrin's relations to him are, it may be
      said here now, once and for all, the entire <i>motif</i> of this episode&mdash;it
      is from first to last an attempt to arrive at a decision as to the real
      reasons of the catastrophe that ultimately occurred; and so, that being
      the case, it may seem that the particulars as to the rest of the people in
      the place, and, indeed, the place itself, are extraneous and unnecessary;
      but they all helped, every one of them, in their own way and their own
      time, to bring about the ultimate disaster, and so they must have their
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill had learnt during his three years at Cambridge that, above all
      things, one must not worry. He had been inclined, a little at first, to
      think, after the easy indolence of Clifton, that one ought to bother. He
      had found that two thirds in his Historical Tripos and a &ldquo;Blue&rdquo;
      for Rugby football were very easily; obtained; he found that the second of
      these things led to a popularity that invited a pleasant indifference to
      thought and discussion, and he was extremely happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; would undoubtedly have secured him something better
      than a post at Moffatt's had he taken more trouble; but He had left
      it, lazily, until the last and had been forced to accept what he could
      get; in a term or two he hoped to return to Clifton.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this meant that his stay at Moffatt's was in the nature of an
      interlude. He buoyantly regarded it as a month or two of &ldquo;learning
      the ropes,&rdquo; and he could not therefore he expected to regard
      masters, boys, or buildings with any very intense seriousness. It is,
      indeed, one of the most curious aspects of the whole affair that he
      remained, for so long a period, blind to all that was going on.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his motives, in his actions, he was of a surprising simplicity. He
      found the world an entirely delightful place&mdash;there was Rugby
      football in the winter, and cricket in the summer; there were splendid
      walks; there was a week in town every now and again; as to people, there
      was his mother&mdash;a widow, and he was her only son&mdash;whom he
      entirely worshiped; there were one or two excellent friends of his from
      Clifton and Cambridge; there was no one whom he really disliked; and there
      were one or two girls, hazily, not very seriously, in the distance, whom
      he had liked very much indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read a little&mdash;liked it when he had time; had a passion for
      Napoleon, whose campaigns he had followed confusedly at Cambridge; and was
      even stirred&mdash;again when he had time&mdash;by certain sorts of
      poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it is this that leads me to one of the questions that are most
      difficult of decision&mdash;as to how strongly, if indeed at all, he had
      any feeling for beauty before he met Isabel Desart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He certainly&mdash;if he had it at this time&mdash;could not put it into
      words; but I believe that he had, in the back of his brain, a kind of
      consciousness about it all, and his meeting with Isabel fired what had
      been lying there waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never, certainly, talked about it, but it will be noticed that he went
      to the wood a great many times, even before he felt Isabel's
      influence, and that he realized quite vividly certain aspects of Pendragon
      and the Flutes; and he would not have cared for <i>Richard Feverel</i>
      quite so passionately had he not had something&mdash;some poetry and
      feeling&mdash;already in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverse of the shield is, at any rate, given in that first letter to
      his mother. He says of Moffatt's: &ldquo;You never saw anything so
      hideous. The red brick all looks so fresh, the stone corridors all smell
      so new, the iron and brass of the place is all so strong and regular. It's
      like the labs at Cambridge on an extensive scale; you'd think they
      were inventing gases or something, not teaching boys the way they should
      go.... All the same, coming up the hill the other night, with the sun
      setting behind it, it looked quite black and grand&mdash;it 's the
      fresh-lobster color of it that I can't stand...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      That shows that he was, to some degree at any rate, sensitive to the way
      that the place looked, and he, in all probability, felt a great deal more
      about it than he ever said to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cambridge may have done something for him&mdash;few people can spend three
      years with these gray palaces and blue waters without some kind of
      development, although probably&mdash;because we are English&mdash;it is
      unconscious.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      He had, during that first week, too much to do to get any very concrete
      idea of the staff. On the first morning of term there was a masters'
      meeting, and he could see them all sitting, heavily, despondently, in
      conclave. There was a gradation of seats, and Traill, of course, took the
      lowest&mdash;a little, hard, sharp one near the window with a shelf just
      above his head, and it knocked him if he moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Moy-Thompson, the head master&mdash;a venerable-looking
      clergyman, with a long grizzled heard and bony fingers&mdash;sat at the
      end of the table in an impatient way, as though he were longing for an
      excuse to fly into a temper. For the others, Traill only noticed one or
      two; Perrin, Dormer, and Clifton were there, of course. There was a large
      stout man with a heavy mustache and a sharp voice like a creaking door; a
      clergyman, thin and rather haggard, with a white wall of a collar much too
      big for him; an agitated little Frenchman, who seemed to expect that at
      any moment he might be the victim of a practical joke; a thin, bony little
      man with a wiry mustache and a biting, cynical speech that seemed to goad
      Moy-Thompson to fury; a nervous and bald-headed man, whose hand
      continually brushed his mustache and whose manner was exceedingly
      deprecating. There were others, but these struck Traill's eyes as
      they roved about.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the discussion that followed concerning the moving of boys up and
      the moving of boys down, the time of lock-up, the possibilities and
      disadvantages of the new boys, it seemed to be everybody's intention
      to be as unpleasant as possible under cover of an agreeable manner. On
      several occasions it seemed that the storm was certain to break, and
      Traill bent eagerly forward in his seat; but the danger was averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the week passed, he found that these men grew more distinct and
      individual. The stout man with the heavy mustache was called Comber; he
      had once been a famous football player, and was now engaged on a book
      concerning the athletes of Greece. The clergyman, the Rev. Stuart, was
      very quiet except on questions of ritual and ceremony, and these things
      stirred him into a passion. The little Frenchman, Monsieur Pons, spent his
      time in hating England and preparing to leave it&mdash;an escape that he
      never achieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little man with the mustache, Birkland by name, seemed to Traill the
      most &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; of them. He was fierce and caustic in his
      manner to everybody and was feared by the whole staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      White, the nervous man, never, so far as Traill could see, opened his
      mouth; and if he did say anything, no one paid the slightest attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of these men, Traill discovered, concerned him very closely, as his
      work was for the most part at the Lower School. He was pleasant to all of
      them, and, if he had thought about it at all, would have said that they
      liked him; but he did not think about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His relations with Dormer, Perrin, and Clinton were quite agreeable.
      Dormer was kind and helpful in a fatherly way; Clinton admired his
      football and liked to compare Oxford (at which he had, several years
      before, been a shining light) with Traill's own university; Perrin
      asked him into his sitting-room for coffee and talked School Education to
      him at infinite length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone, during this first week, was quite pleasant and agreeable.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The ladies of the establishment came to Traill's notice more slowly;
      and they came to him, of course, considering his temperament, quite
      indefinitely and without his own immediate realization of anything. He
      could point, of course, to the moment of his meeting Isabel, because, from
      that moment, his life was changed; but it was the meeting rather than any
      keen and tangible idea of her that he realized.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is essential, however, that Mrs. Comber should appear on the scene a
      good deal more clearly than he would ever probably see her. She had so
      much to do with everything that occurred&mdash;quite unconsciously, poor
      lady, as indeed she was always unconscious of anything until it was over&mdash;that
      she demands a close attempt at accurate presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immediate impressions that she left on any observer, however casual,
      were of size and color, and of all the things that go with those
      qualities. She was large, immense, and seemed, from her movements and her
      air of rather tentatively and timidly embracing the world, to be even
      larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hair was of a blackness and her cheeks of a redness that hinted at
      foreign blood, but was derived in reality from nothing more than Cornish
      descent&mdash;and that indeed may, if you please, be taken as foreign
      enough. There was a great deal of hair piled on her head, and in her
      continual smiles and anxiety to be pleasant there seemed, too, to be a
      great deal of her red cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those earlier days, the daughter of a country clergyman, and the
      youngest of six sisters, she had been, when so permitted, jolly, noisy,
      with a tremendous sense of life. The key that was going, she believed, to
      unlock life for her was Romance, and she looked eagerly and
      enthusiastically down the dusty road to watch for the coming of some
      knight. When he came in the person of Freddie Comber, young, handsome,
      athletic, and the most devout of lovers, she felt that, now that her lamp
      was lighted, she had only got to keep the flame burning and she would be
      happy for ever. That&mdash;the keeping of it alight&mdash;seemed, as she
      looked at the handsome and ardent Freddie, an easy enough thing to do. She
      did not know that Fate very often, having given a tempting glimpse and
      even a positive handling of its burnished brass and intricate tracing,
      removes it altogether&mdash;merely, as it may seem to some cynical
      observers of life, for the fun of the thing. In any case, from the moment
      of her marriage, Mrs. Comber's eager hands found nothing to hold on
      to at all, and she passed, in the ensuing years from a plucky
      determination to make the &ldquo;second best&rdquo; do, to the final blind
      acquiescence in anything at all that might have the faintest resemblance
      to that earlier glorious radiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freddie Comber's transition from the handsome, enthusiastic young
      lover into the stout, lethargic and querulous Mr. Comber, master of the
      Middle Fourth and anticipatory author of a work on the athletes of Greece,
      would need an exhaustive treatise on &ldquo;Public School Education as
      applied to our Masters&rdquo; for its reasonable analysis. Perhaps this
      faithful account of the relations of Perrin and Traill may offer some
      solution to that and other more complex riddles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It says, however, everything for Mrs. Comber's pluck and determined
      stupidity that she lived, even now, after fifteen years' married
      life, at the threshold of expectation. Things that were apparent to the
      complete stranger in his first five minutes' interview with Comber
      were hidden, wilfully and proudly hidden, from <i>her</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She yielded to facts, however, in this one particular, that she extended
      her attempts at Romance to wider fields. It always might return as far as
      Freddie was concerned&mdash;she was continually hoping and expecting that
      it would; but meanwhile she dug diligently in other grounds. Her three
      boys&mdash;fat, stolid, stupid, pugnacious&mdash;cared, they showed her
      quite plainly, nothing for her at all; but she put that down to their age,
      to their school, even to their appetites, their clothes, anything that
      pointed to a probable change in the future. In their holidays she spent
      her days in eagerly loving them and being repulsed, and then in hiding her
      love under a troubled indifference and being entirely disregarded.... They
      were unpleasant boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another place for digging was the ground of &ldquo;things,&rdquo; of
      property. Having had nothing at all when she was a girl, and having almost
      nothing&mdash;they were very poor, and she &ldquo;managed&rdquo; badly&mdash;now,
      she had always had an intense feeling for possession. She was generous to
      an amazing degree, and would give anything, in her tangled, impetuous kind
      of way, to anybody without a moment's thought. But she loved her
      valuables. They were very few. Potatoes and cabbages, clothing and
      school-bills for the boys, consumed any money that there might happen to
      be, and consumed it in a muddled, helpless kind of way that she was never
      able to prevent or correct. But things had come to her&mdash;been given,
      left, or eagerly seized in a wild moment's extravagance,&mdash;and
      these she cherished with all her eyes and hands. The peacock-blue Liberty
      screen, the ormolu clock, some few pieces of dainty Dresden china, some
      brass Indian pots, a small but musically charming piano, some sketches and
      two good prints, and edition de luxe of Walter Pater (a wedding-present,
      and she had never opened one of these beautiful volumes), some silver, a
      teapot, a tray, some cups that Freddie had won in an earlier, more
      glorious period, some small pieces of jewelry&mdash;over these things she
      passed every morning with a delicate, lingering touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clumsy and awkward as she generally was, when she approached her valuables
      she became another person: she would lie awake thinking about them....
      They seemed&mdash;dumb things as they were&mdash;to give her something of
      the affection for which, from more eloquent persons, she was always so
      continually searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as clumsy in her relations to all her neighbors and acquaintances
      as she was in her movements and her finances. She was famous for her want
      of tact; famous, too, for a certain coarseness and bluntness of speech;
      famous for a childlike and transparent attempt to make people like her&mdash;an
      attempt that, from its transparency, always with wiser and more cynical
      persons failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She generally thought of three things at once and tried to talk about them
      all; she was quite aware that most of the ladies connected with the town
      and the neighborhood disliked her, and she never, although she wondered in
      a kind of muddled dismay why it was, could discover a satisfactory reason.
      She spent her years in cheerfully rushing into people's lives and
      being hurriedly bundled out again&mdash;which &ldquo;bundling,&rdquo; at
      every reiteration of it, left her as confused and dismayed as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      But against all this rejection and muddled confusion there was, of course,
      to be set Isabel Desart. What Miss Desart was to Mrs. Comber no simple
      succession of printed words can possibly say. She was, in her free,
      spontaneous fashion, a great many things to a great many people; but to
      none of them was she quite the special and wonderful gift that she was to
      Mrs. Comber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was some feeling of this kind that brought her so often, and
      for so long a period, down to Moffatt's&mdash;a proceeding that her
      London friends could never even vaguely understand. That she&mdash;having,
      as she might, such a glorious &ldquo;time&rdquo; in London behind her&mdash;should
      care to go and stay for so long a period at that dullest of places, a
      school, with those dullest and most arid of people, scholastic authorities
      (this term to include wives as well as husbands), was indeed to them all a
      total mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber, with all her faults and insufficiencies, would have seemed a
      poor enough answer to the riddle as an answer; it was, in fact, only
      partial.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to Mrs. Comber, there was Cornwall; and Cornwall, as it was at
      Moffatt's, was quite enough to draw Isabel unerringly, irresistibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the place&mdash;the surroundings, the look of it all, the &ldquo;sense&rdquo;
      of it&mdash;there is more to be said in a moment&mdash;being seen, more
      completely perhaps, with Traill's new and unaccustomed eyes; it is
      enough here that, on every separate occasion of her coming, it meant to
      Isabel deeper and more vital experiences. She was beginning even to be
      afraid that it was not going to let her go again: its sea, its hard, black
      rocks, its golden gorge, its deep green lanes, its gray-roofed cottages
      that nestled in bowls and cups of color as no cottages nestle anywhere
      else in the world&mdash;these were all things that she dreamed of
      afterwards, when she had left them, to the extent, it began to seem to
      her, of danger and confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She herself &ldquo;fitted in&rdquo; as only a few people out of the many
      that go there could ever do.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her rather short brown hair that curled about her head, her straight
      eyes, her firm mouth, her vigorous, unerring movements, the swing of her
      arms as she walked, she seemed as though her strength and honesty might
      forbid her softer graces. To most people she was a delightful boy&mdash;splendidly
      healthy, direct, uncompromising, sometimes startling in her hatred of
      things and people, sometimes arrogant in her assured enthusiasms; Mrs.
      Comber, who, in her muddled eager way, had told her so much, knew of the
      other side of her, of her tenderness, her understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys loved her, and she had been their envoy on many occasions of
      peril and disaster; they always trusted her to carry things through, and
      she generally did.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only, perhaps, with the other ladies of the establishment that she
      did not altogether find favor. The other ladies consisted of Mrs.
      Moy-Thompson, Mrs. Dormer, and the lady matrons&mdash;Miss Bonhurst, the
      two Misses Madder, and Miss Tremans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Moy-Thompson, a thin, faded lady in perpetual black, had long ago
      been crushed into a miserable negligibility by her masterful husband. She
      very seldom spoke at all and, when she did, hurriedly corrected what she
      had just said in a sudden fear lest she should be misunderstood. She
      allowed her husband to bully her to his heart's content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dormer, stern, with the manner of one who never says what she means,
      had never got over the disappointment of her husband having, fifteen years
      before, missed the head-mastership. She was continually finding new
      reasons for this omission and venting her dislike on people who had had
      nothing whatever to do with it. She was neat and puritanical, and hated
      Mrs. Comber because she was neither of these things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the matrons, it may be enough to say that they all disliked each other,
      but were perfectly ready to combine in their mutual dislike of the other
      ladies; they felt that their position demanded that they should assert
      their birth and breeding; they also felt that Mrs. Comber and Mrs. Dormer
      looked down on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best of them was the matron of the Lower School, the elder Miss Madder&mdash;stout
      and kind-hearted and extremely capable. She made up for the undeniable
      fact that no one had ever asked her to change her name for a pleasanter
      one by loving the small boys of the Lower School with a warmth and
      good-humor that they none of them, in after life, forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so there they all were&mdash;most of them&mdash;a background, and
      simply, as individuals, witnesses to the whole case and, perhaps, by
      reason of their very existence, factors in assisting the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were, most of them, never in young Traill's consciousness at
      all&mdash;Miss Madder, perhaps because she was at the Lower School; Mrs.
      Comber, because Isabel was staying with her... and Isabel.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      A word, finally, about the surrounding country.
    </p>
    <p>
      It becomes, perhaps, at once most definitely presented if you take the
      Brown Hill as the center, and Pendragon to the right along the coast, and
      Truro inland to the left&mdash;both at an equal distance&mdash;as the
      farthest boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between Truro and Moffatt's there is a ridge of hill&mdash;undulating,
      gently, vaguely shaped, with its cool brown colors melting into the blue
      or gray of the sky as dim clouds melt into one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Brown Hill itself rises sharply, steeply, straight from the sea, with
      the little village&mdash;Chattock&mdash;at its feet, curling with its
      steep, cobbled street up the incline. Halfway down the hill there is a
      wood&mdash;the Brown Wood&mdash;and it hangs with all its feathery trees
      in friendly, eager fashion over the little white-stoned and yellow-sanded
      cove (so tiny and so perfect in its shape and color that it almost audibly
      cries out not to be touched). There is a little part of the wood where the
      trees part and you may sit, in a kind of magical wonder, right over the
      gray carpet of the sea, hearing what the wood, with its creaking and
      bending and rustling, is saying to the water and what the water, with its
      slipping and hissing and singing, is saying to the wood. Of the two towns
      Pendragon has become, from the invasion of the Vandals, modern and
      monotonous. It had, not so long ago, a cove on its outskirts&mdash;that
      was the whole of Cornwall in a tiny space; now there is a row of modern
      villas, red-roofed and wooden-paled. Traill, in his visits there, was
      concerned with the chief house there&mdash;The Flutes, owned by a certain
      Sir Henry Trojan, whose son, Robin Trojan, had been, although senior, a
      friend at Cambridge. The house was beautiful both in its position and in
      the spirit of its owner, and Traill snatched what moments he could to
      visit it and to snatch a respite there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he known, it became in the back of his mind a contrast with the
      &ldquo;lobster red&rdquo; and the stone corridors of Moffatt's, so
      that he took its wide, high rooms and its shining, ordered garden with an
      added sense of richness. Had he realized how soon its dignity and peace
      stood to him for an &ldquo;escape,&rdquo; he would have realized also his
      growing protest against his voluntary imprisonment. He went over also on
      occasions to Truro&mdash;because he liked the walk over the hill, because
      he liked certain quaintnesses in the market, in the sharp cobbles of Lemon
      Street, in the higher breezes of Kenwyn, because, above all, he liked the
      dark quiet and solemnity of the Cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point about both Pendragon and Truro is that it was the kind of life
      that he was leading at Moffatt's&mdash;the sides of it that are soon
      to be given you in detail&mdash;that led him to notice these places.
      Contrast drove him to a sudden opening of his eyes&mdash;contrast and
      Isabel Desart. He was growing so very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In letters to his mother he spoke of a splendid little wood where one
      could sit and watch the sea for hours if there was only time; of the funny
      old hill, all brown, with the white road curling up it; of calling at The
      Flutes, and &ldquo;Sir Henry Trojan and Lady Trojan being most awfully
      kind,&rdquo; and the house being quite beautiful, but very little about
      the people of the school, and during those first few weeks nothing at all
      about Isabel Desart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until Mrs. Comber gave her dinner-party that the preliminaries
      could be said to be over.

      CHAPTER III&mdash;CONCERNS ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS THAT MAY HAPPEN
      BETWEEN SOUP AND DESSERT
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Mrs. Comber
      asked Vincent Perrin to her dinner-party he was delighted, although he
      assumed as great an indifference as possible. This was at the end of the
      first week of term, and he had not spoken to Miss Desart&mdash;he had
      merely bowed to her across the grass and gone indoors to teach the Lower
      Third algebra with a beating heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was also fortunately prevented from seeing that Mrs. Comber was giving
      the dinner for Traill. If he had seen that, things might have been very
      different; as it was, he thought that that kind, good-natured woman (he
      did not always like her) had noticed his attachment&mdash;as he thought
      most carefully concealed&mdash;to Miss Desart and wanted to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself had not noticed the attachment until the holidays. She had
      stayed at Moffatt's during part of the summer term, and he had
      played tennis with her and talked to her and even walked with her. But it
      was not until he had returned to the seclusion of his aged mother and
      Buckinghamshire that he realized that for the first time for twenty years
      he was in love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery affected him in many ways. In the first place it swept away
      in the most curious manner all the years that had intervened since the
      last affair. He was suddenly young again. He began to regret the way that
      he had spent his days. He played tennis (badly but with enthusiasm). He
      talked to the men of his Club about &ldquo;the absurdity of considering
      forty-five any age,&rdquo; and quoted juvenile athletes of eighty. He gave
      his mustache a terrible time, wearing things to hold it straight at night,
      looking at it often in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told his aged mother (a very old lady with a brown, shriveled face, a
      white lace cap, and mittens) vaguely but magnificently about there being
      somebody. He hinted that she cared for him and was eager to marry him as
      soon as he felt ready to ask her. He talked about &ldquo;getting a house,&rdquo;
      even about wallpapers and stair-carpets and a nice sunny room for the old
      lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was delighted at first, and then agitated. Who might this new young
      person be? Perhaps she would not like her&mdash;in any case, it meant
      taking a second place. But she idolized and worshiped her son: she knew
      sides of him that no one else knew&mdash;she saw him as a little, thin,
      serious hoy in knickerbockers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this new spirit revived things in Vincent Perrin that he had long
      thought dead. He knew, he savagely knew, in his heart of hearts, that he
      was a failure; he was determined that the world should never know it; he
      covered his knowledge with a multitude of disguises; but now perhaps, if
      she cared for him, there might yet be a chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But most of all he was afraid of something&mdash;he could never give it a
      name&mdash;that always crept slowly, increasingly over him as term
      advanced. He could not give it a name: that thing made up of a myriad
      details, of a myriad vexations; that evil spirit that they all, the
      masters and the rest, seemed to feel as the weeks gathered in numbers&mdash;the
      end-of-termy feelings: strained nerves, irritated tempers, almost, the
      last week or two when examinations came, seeing red.
    </p>
    <p>
      No&mdash;this term it <i>shall</i> be all right. He felt, as he said
      good-by to his mother and kissed her, almost an eagerness to get back and
      prove that it was all right. After all, Searle had left, and there was
      Miss Desart. Supposing she cared for him? He twisted his thin fingers
      together. Oh! what things he could do!
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he was glad of Mrs. Comber's dinner-party.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Giving a dinner-party was no light, easy thing for Mrs. Comber. So many
      wide issues were involved. Not very many dinner-parties were given during
      the term, and Mrs. Comber was perfectly aware of all the conversation that
      it would give rise to, of all the people that would in all probability be
      angry with all the other people because they had been asked or because
      they had not. There was, generally, a reason for a dinner. Some important
      person had to be asked, some unimportant people had to be worked off,
      someone was conscious that there had not been a dinner-party for a very
      long time. But on this occasion there was no reason except that Mrs.
      Comber had liked the look of young Traill, had at once thought of Isabel,
      and had conceived a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, of course, it followed that other people must be asked: Vincent
      Perrin, because she didn't like him, but felt that she ought to; the
      Dormers, because it was time they were asked; and the elder Miss Madder,
      because she was the nicest of the matrons and wouldn't talk quite so
      much and quite so spitefully as the others would.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this involved danger and destruction as far as the people invited were
      concerned. One chance word at dinner&mdash;some errant, tiny omission or
      commission&mdash;and anything might happen: the time might be made
      miserable for everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was more immediate peril in it than that. There was in the first
      place &ldquo;ways and means.&rdquo; How this harassed poor Mrs. Comber no
      words can say. She was forced to drive her frail cockle-shell of a boat
      between the Scylla of increased bills and the Charybdis of
      not-being-smart-enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were things not right&mdash;if there were no meringues, no mushroom
      savories (there were rules and regulations about these things), no kummel&mdash;well,
      the party had better not be given at all. And then, on the other hand,
      there was the end of the month, nothing in hand to pay, and Freddie
      scowling over his <i>Greek Athletes</i> to such an extent that it wouldn't
      do to speak to him. All this was dreadfully difficult, but it revolved in
      reality almost entirely around Freddie's stout figure. Every
      dinner-party, every party of any kind, was an attempt to win Freddie back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber never confessed this even to herself, and she was, poor woman,
      only too completely aware that its usual result was to drive Freddie only
      more completely &ldquo;in.&rdquo; Something was sure to happen, before the
      evening was over, to annoy him&mdash;she would have &ldquo;such a time
      afterwards.&rdquo; But it always, of course, might be the other way. He
      might suddenly see, by some little word or act, how fond, how terribly
      fond, she was of him. She had learnt Bridge to please him&mdash;he used to
      like a game; but the result, although she would not admit it, had simply
      been disastrous.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was much too muddled a person to be good at cards&mdash;she was very,
      very bad; she lost sixpences and shillings with the sinking feeling in her
      heart that they ought to be going to pay for their boys' clothes.
      She plunged desperately to win it all back again&mdash;she was known
      throughout the neighborhood as the worst player in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed this conclusion to the evening that she dreaded most of all.
      There were eight of them, so, of course, they would have to play. Her
      heart sank because of all the things that might happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Isabel was, of course, the greatest use in the world. She saved all
      kinds of needless extravagances; she always got things where they were
      cheap and not bad, instead of getting them expensive and rotten. She
      thought of a thousand little things, and she managed the servants&mdash;only
      two of them, and both ill-tempered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber said nothing to Isabel about young Traill&mdash;she did not
      even think that she had as yet noticed him. They neither of them said a
      word about Mr. Perrin.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Gathered all together in the drawing-room, it was everybody's chief
      object to avoid knocking things over. This may be taken metaphorically as
      well as literally, but in that ten minutes' prelude everyone had the
      hard task of being socially agreeable to people whom they met, as they met
      their tables and their chairs, their beds and their hair-brushes, every
      day of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtains; had been closely drawn, but outside the winds were up and
      were beating with wild fingers at the panes. They gathered in clusters
      about the house, screamed in derision at the dinner-party, chattered
      wildly round the buttresses and chimneys of the sedate and solemn
      buildings, and then rushed furiously down the gravel paths and away to the
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall lamp had been so placed that its light fell on the peacock-blue
      screen and the ormolu clock; it also fell on the enormous shoulders, in
      black silk, of Miss Madder, on the thin, bony neck of Mrs. Dormer, and on
      the deep red of Mrs. Comber's dress (open at one place at the back,
      where it should have been closed, and cut, Mrs. Dormer considered, a great
      deal lower than it need have been).
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all waiting for Mr. Comber, and Mrs. Comber was trying to
      explain to Traill why Freddie was always late, why people at Moffatt's
      always liked meringues, and why with a magnificent &ldquo;heart&rdquo;
      hand she had, only two nights ago, gone hearts with most disastrous
      results. &ldquo;They like them best with jam in them&mdash;you shall see
      to-night if they aren't good; and there was really no reason at all
      why they shouldn't have come off, but we had such bad luck, and I
      oughtn't to have played my King when I did; I'm always telling
      him that he ought to go and dress a little earlier&mdash;but he stays
      working.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Mrs. Comber! She was talking with her eyes all about the room, with a
      sickening consciousness that something was wrong with her dress at the
      back, with a sure and a certain knowledge that it would be related in the
      common room the next morning that dinner was kept half an hour too long,
      with a keen misgiving that Mrs. Dormer and Miss Madder had quarreled
      furiously only the day before and that she had known nothing about it.
      Every now and again she glanced at Isabel to gather comfort from her, and
      Isabel's eyes were always ready to give it her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel was standing in a dark corner by the window, talking to Vincent
      Perrin. Her dress was of dark brown silk, very simply cut, and falling in
      one straight piece, save for a golden girdle that bound her waist. She was
      standing with that perfect repose that came to her so naturally; when she
      moved it was as though that was the only movement possible&mdash;her limbs
      did not seem to hesitate, as do the limbs of so many people, before they
      could decide on the way that they were going to act. Her brown eyes were
      smiling at Vincent Perrin in a very friendly way, and his heart was
      beating a great deal faster than it had ever beaten before.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taken very especial pains with his dressing that night. He found
      that there were only three shirts in his drawer and that the cuffs of two
      of them were badly frayed, and that the stud-hole in the third was so
      broken that it would need a very large stud indeed to fill it. He found a
      kind of soup-plate at last, but was painfully conscious of its brazen size
      and of a little brown smudge on the front of the shirt near the collar.
      His suit&mdash;it had done duty for a great many years&mdash;was painfully
      shiny in the back: he had never noticed it before; and there was a small
      tear in one sleeve that he knew everyone would see. His hair, in spite of
      water, was lanky and uneven; his mustache was raggeder than ever; his coat
      fell over his cuffs and shot them into obscurity in the most distressing
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things were new discomforts and distresses&mdash;he had never
      cared about them before. Then, when Isabel was so kind to him, he felt
      that they did not matter; he began in another few minutes to believe that
      he was rather well dressed after all; after ten minutes'
      conversation he was proud of his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly his eye fell on Traill, and that moment must be recorded as
      the first moment of his dislike. Traill was absurd, quite absurd&mdash;over-dressed
      in fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hair was brushed and parted so that you could almost see your face in
      brown glossiness. His coat fitted amazingly. There was a wonderful white
      waistcoat with pearl buttons, there were wonderful silk socks with pale
      blue clocks, there was a splendid even line of white cuff below the
      sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Perrin was forced to admit that this smartness was not common; it was
      quite natural, as though Traill had always worn clothes like that. Could
      it be that Perrin was shabby... <i>not</i> that Traill was smart?
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin dragged his cuffs from their dark hiding-places, then saw that
      there was a new frayed piece that had escaped his scissors, and pushed
      them back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all went in to dinner.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Traill took Isabel in. That was the first time that she had consciously
      recognized him&mdash;even then it was fleeting and was confined in reality
      to a vague approval... and she liked his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never seen her before&mdash;that is, he had never detached her from
      the vague background of people moving in the distance against the trees
      and the buildings; but now at once he fell in love with her. He had been
      in love before, and the strange suddenness of the ending of those fugitive
      episodes&mdash;the way that it had been, in an instant, like a candle
      blown out&mdash;had led him to fancy that love was always like that; he
      had even begun to be a little cynical about it. But he was in no way a
      complicated person. It didn't seem to him in the least strange that
      yesterday he should have laughed at love and that now he should have a
      sense of beauty and strange wonder&mdash;something that had suddenly, like
      streaming silk or a sweeping, golden sunlight, flooded Mrs. Comber's
      dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought her very grave; he noticed the white, crinkly sound of the silk
      of her dress against the table, the broad bands of light in her hair, and
      the way that her fingers, so slim and soft and yet so strong, touched the
      white cloth; and when she asked him whether he had ever been a
      schoolmaster before, the soup suddenly choked him and he could not answer
      her, but blushed like a fool, waving a spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you like it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>love</i> it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far. Well, you shall cherish your illusions.&rdquo; She still
      looked at him very gravely. &ldquo;The boys like you so far.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! they told you!&rdquo; He was pleased at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! one soon knows&mdash;they are cruelly frank.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she caught her eyes away from him and looked down the table. Mrs.
      Comber was in distress. Everyone had finished their soup a terribly long
      time before, and there was no sign of the fish. One of those pauses that
      are so cruelly eloquent fell about the table. Freddie Comber was moodily
      staring at his plate and paying no attention at all to Dormer, who was
      trying to be pleasant. Mrs. Dormer was sitting up stiffly in her chair and
      gazing at Landseer's &ldquo;Dignity and Imprudence&rdquo; that hung
      on the opposite wall as though she had never seen it before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at moments like this that Mrs. Comber felt as though the room got
      up and hit one in the face. She was always terribly conscious of her
      dining-room. It was a room, she felt, &ldquo;with nothing at all in it.&rdquo;
      It had a wallpaper that she hated; she had always intended to have a new
      one, but there had never been quite enough money to spend on something
      that was not, after all, a necessity. The Landseer picture offended her,
      although she could give no reason&mdash;perhaps she did not care about
      dogs. The sideboard was a dreadfully cheap one, with imitation brass knobs
      to the doors of the cupboards, and there were three shelves of dusty and
      tattered books that never got cleared away.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things seemed to rise and scream at her. She noticed, too, with
      a little pang of dismay that one of the glass dessert dishes was missing.
      The set had been one of their wedding-presents&mdash;the nicest present
      that they had had. Oh! those servants!... She talked with a brave smile to
      anybody and everybody, but she watched furtively her husband's
      gloomy face.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Isabel, having given her a smile, turned back and attacked Mr. Perrin,
      feeling, as she always did about him, that she was sorry for him, that she
      wanted to be kind to him, and that she would be so glad when her duty
      would be over. She also noticed that she wanted to talk to Traill again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin himself had been in a state of torture during dinner that was, for
      him, an entirely; new experience. Traill had taken her in.... His thoughts
      hung about this fact as bees hang about a tree. Traill&mdash;Traill...
      with his elegant waistcoat and his beautiful shirt. He splashed his soup
      on to his plate. As through a mist people's words came to him&mdash;Miss
      Madder's fat, cheerful voice: &ldquo;Oh! I think we shall fill the
      West Dormitory this term. There are five small Newsoms&mdash;all new boys,
      poor dears.&rdquo;... Comber himself, growling at the end of the table to
      Dormer: &ldquo;It's perfectly absurd. It means that Birk-land has
      one hour less than the rest of us&mdash;that middle hour ten to eleven...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The same old subjects, the same old dinners&mdash;but with her he was
      going to escape from it all; with her by his side, his ambition would grow
      wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw himself at Eton or Harrow, or a school-inspectorship. Why not? He
      was able enough. It only needed something to force him out of the rut.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Traill had taken her in....
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she turned and spoke to him, and at once he put up his hand as
      though he would stroke his chin, but really it was to cover the stud&mdash;the
      large soup-plate stud. He stroked his straggling mustache, and used his
      official voice. He spoke as he always did when he wanted to create an
      impression, as though in the cloistral courts of Cambridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slow, deliberate, a little majestic... he shot his cuff back into his
      sleeve. He spoke of ambition, of the things that a man could do if he
      tried, of the things that <i>he</i> could do, if&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If?&rdquo; said Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! well, if... marriage, for instance, was such a help to a man...
      one never knew&mdash;&rdquo; He drank furiously and finished at a gulp a
      glass of Freddie Comber's very bad claret.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Traill was having a very good time indeed with Miss Madder, and
      Isabel turned round to hear what they were talking about. The meringues
      had arrived&mdash;there was also fruit-salad, but everyone took meringues
      although they would have liked, had they dared, to take both&mdash;and
      conversation was quite lively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dormer, &ldquo;that there will be
      several extra halves this term.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at once poor Mrs. Comber, who was eagerly congratulating herself on
      the success with which, so far, she had escaped danger, burst in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, so do I. You know, they always used to give the boys a half for
      every new baby born on the establishment. Well, you and I have done our
      duty nobly in that direction, haven't we, Mrs. Dormer?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible that those who are not acquainted with both ladies should
      have any conception of the disaster that this simple sentence involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dormer had a glorious, pugnacious prudery in her stiff, angular body
      that rejoiced in any opportunity for display. She hated Mrs. Comber; she
      had now an excuse for being offended for weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could embroider and discuss to her heart's delight. She saw in
      the amusement of Miss Madder, the discomfort of her husband, the dismay of
      Miss Desart, the distaste of Mr. Perrin, the wrath of Mr. Comber, ample
      confirmation of her exultant prophecies. It does not take much to make a
      scandal at Moffatt's&mdash;and the propriety of the schoolmaster,
      the anxious, eager propriety, exceeds the propriety of every other
      profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dormer had the game in her hands, and she played the first move by
      sitting silently, whitely, protestingly in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>do</i> hope the football will be good this season,&rdquo; she
      said at last, quietly and patiently, to Mr. Comber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber realized at once that she was defeated. She did not know why
      she had said a thing like that&mdash;she knew that Mrs. Dormer didn't
      like such things to be talked about. She smiled and laughed and talked
      about gardens and the school bell and Mrs. Moy-Thompson's hat.
      &ldquo;It always rings half a note flat, and it's no use speaking
      about it; and how she can bear that colored green when it's the last
      color she <i>ought</i> to wear, I <i>can't</i> think; if it weren't
      for these flies&mdash;what do you call them!&mdash;the roses would have
      done quite well.&rdquo; But her eyes stared desperately down the table at
      Freddie, and she saw that he would not look at her, and she knew that the
      dinner had been only one more nail in her coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still, of course, Bridge.
    </p>
    <h3>
      V.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sitting at the little tables in the tiny drawing-room afterwards, they
      were all tremendously&mdash;as of course you must be at such small tables&mdash;conscious
      of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had drawn lots, and Mrs. Comber was playing with Dormer against her
      husband and Miss Madder at one table, and Mr. Perrin was playing with Mrs.
      Dormer against Isabel and young Traill at another.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may seem a slight thing, but it was certainly a factor in the whole
      situation that Perrin was forced to gaze&mdash;over a very small
      intervening space&mdash;at Traill's immaculate clothes for the rest
      of the evening. He was always a bad Bridge player&mdash;he thought that he
      disguised his bad play by a haughty manner and a false assurance; to-night
      the confusion of his thoughts, his incipient dislike for Traill, the bad
      claret that he had drunk, the distracting way that Miss Desart held her
      cards, caused his play to be something insane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dormer disliked intensely losing money, and there seemed every
      prospect, if Perrin continued to play like that, of her losing at least
      five shillings before the end of the evening. She was convinced that she
      had every reason for being angry, and when, at the end of the first deal,
      her partner had thrown away a splendid heart hand by refusing to follow
      any of her leads, she could not resist a stiff movement in her chair and a
      sharp, &ldquo;Well, Mr. Perrin, I think we ought to have done better than
      that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in his experience his usual assured reply, containing
      an implication that it was all his partner's fault, that he had been
      at Cambridge for three years, and that he taught Algebra and Euclid six
      days a week and therefore ought to know how to play Bridge if anyone did,
      failed him. He stared at her miserably, gathered the cards hurriedly
      together, and began to shuffle them in a dreadfully confused way. He knew
      that Miss Desart must think him a fool, and he wanted her so terribly
      badly to think him clever and even brilliant. He was sure that Traill was
      laughing at him. He hated the assurance with which he played. If only he,
      Perrin, had been playing with Miss Desart what things he might have
      done.... His head ached, and his shirt creaked a little every time he
      moved, and every time it creaked Mrs. Dormer made a little stir of
      disapproval.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the other table also things were not as they should be. The drawing of
      lots had secured precisely the combination of players that Mrs. Comber had
      most wished to avoid. Whatever she did, however she played, she was lost.
      If she played badly, her husband, although playing against her, was
      infuriated at her stupidity; if she won, he hated being beaten, As it was,
      she was playing extremely badly, but was winning because of the good cards
      that she held. His brow was growing blacker and blacker. She held her
      cards so badly&mdash;she never could make them into a fan, and every now
      and again one fell with a sharp rattle against the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also she forgot sometimes that they were playing and broke into sentences
      that had to be instantly checked&mdash;as, for instance: &ldquo;Oh, I saw
      Mrs.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; I'm so sorry, it 's my lead.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe <i>this</i> term.... Oh! I beg your pardon.... <i>What</i>
      are trumps?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Every now and again she gazed at the peacock screen, and the clock, and
      the dark corner of the room where there was a little water-color in a gilt
      frame, and they gave her comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of the rubber came, and Mrs. Dormer refused to play any more; they
      had had magnificent cards, but she had lost three shillings. She wouldn't
      look at Mr. Perrin. He stood nervously moving one foot against the other,
      pulling his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, really I'm afraid we must go. You 've finished your
      rubber, Mrs. Comber? Yes, we <i>ought</i> to have won.... No, I can't
      think how it was.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Considering the way my wife's been playing,&rdquo; said
      Freddie Comber brutally, &ldquo;I think it is just as well to stop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber chattered with amazing confusion as she helped Mrs. Dormer to
      get her cloak. In her eyes something bright was shining, and every now and
      again she put up her band to push back some of her black hair (always on
      the edge of a perilous descent) with a little, desperate action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night. I'm so glad you've enjoyed it. We meet
      to-morrow, of course, although I can't think why they aren't
      going to play golf&mdash;there's going to be <i>such</i> a storm in
      an hour or two, isn't there?&mdash;probably because it's
      football to-morrow afternoon. Yes, good-by.&rdquo; Everyone departed. Mr.
      Perrin stood desperately with something going up and down in his throat.
      He had a sentence in his head: &ldquo;Please, Miss Desart, <i>do</i> let
      me see you back to the lodge.&rdquo; (Mrs. Comber had had to plant her out
      there to sleep because there was no room in their own tiny house.) He
      meant to say it, he wanted to say it. He clutched his mortar-board
      frantically in his band. Then suddenly be beard Traill's voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! please, Miss Desart&mdash;of course, I'll see you back.
      Good night, Mrs. Comber. Thank you <i>so</i> much&mdash;I've <i>loved</i>
      it. Good night, Comber. Night, Perrin. Look out, Miss Desart, it's
      dark.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin felt his band just touched by Miss Desart's, and her voice,
      &ldquo;Good night, Mr. Perrin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was left alone on the step.
    </p>
    <h3>
      VI.
    </h3>
    <p>
      I don't suppose that at this stage of things Isabel bad the very
      slightest idea of all the emotions that had been in play that evening. Her
      bead, as they walked away down the dark gravel path, was full of her
      hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Mrs. Comber,&rdquo; she said, and then checked herself as
      though there were some disloyalty in talking about her. &ldquo;I hate Mrs.
      Dormer,&rdquo; she added quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like her,&rdquo; Traill said. &ldquo;And Dormer's
      such a jolly little man. I don't envy; him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I don't suppose it's her fault any more than it's
      anyone's fault here about anything they do. It's all a case of
      nerves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was going to be a storm soon. Already that little preparatory
      whisper of the wind, the ominous, frightened rustle of the leaves down the
      path, was about them. It was all very dark, with a curious white light on
      the horizon, and the dark buildings of the Lower School huddled against it
      in sharp, black outline like the broad backs of giants bending to the
      soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scent of trees&mdash;vague and uncertain in the daytime, but now clear
      and pungent&mdash;was borne through the air, and the voice of the sea,
      rolling in long, mournful cadences far below the hills, came up to them.
      The wind's whisper grew into a furious, strangled cry; little eddies
      of it swept about their feet, and cascades of withered leaves fell wildly
      against them and were blown, sweeping, streaming away.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were silent. Traill was thinking of her voice. It was so grave and
      assured and restful. He thought that he could trust her tremendously. But
      there was reserve in it too, and he felt, a little hopelessly, that he
      might never perhaps get to know her better.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got to the lodge gates, they stopped and stood for a moment
      silently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she said, looking very gravely in front of her at the dark bend of
      the road, &ldquo;There must be such a storm coming up. I feel it all
      through me. It <i>was</i> depressing to-night, was n't it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyhow, I'm glad you like it&mdash;being here. Mind you
      always do. I don't want to be pessimistic when you are just
      beginning; but&mdash;well, you don't mean to stay here for ever, do
      you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think not,&rdquo; he answered eagerly. &ldquo;Only a term
      or two at the most, and then I hope to go back to Clifton, my old school.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right&mdash;because&mdash;really it isn't a very
      good place to be&mdash;this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's difficult to explain without maligning people and making
      things out worse than they really are.&rdquo; She paused a moment, and
      then she went on: &ldquo;Do you know, at the bottom of the hill, just
      before you get into the village, a melancholy orchard? One always passes
      it. You will see at the right time of the year lots of green apples on the
      trees, but they never seem to come to anything. And such blossoms in the
      spring! I 've seen men working there sometimes. I don't know
      what it is, but nothing 's any good there. They call it in the
      village 'Green Apple Orchard.'... Well, I've stayed here
      a great deal, and there's an obvious comparison.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's cheerful,&rdquo; he said, laughing. &ldquo;It would, I
      suppose, be awful if one had to stay here for ever like Perrin and Dormer
      and the rest of them; but this time next year will see me somewhere
      better, I hope.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mind you stick to that,&rdquo; she said eagerly. &ldquo;I have a
      horrible kind of feeling that they all meant to go very soon; but here
      they are still&mdash;soured, disappointed. Oh! it doesn't bear
      thinking of.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One must have ambition,&rdquo; he answered her confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him, and took his hand, and said good night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went, smiling, to his room. As he climbed into bed, the storm broke
      furiously.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T the end of his
      first month young Traill looked back, as it were from the top of a hill,
      and thought that it all had been very pleasant. How much of this
      pleasantness was due to Isabel (although he had seen her during that
      period extremely seldom) and how much of it was due to his agreeable
      acceptance of things as they were without any very definite challenge to
      them to be different, it is impossible to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowded day had of course something to do with it: the fact that there
      was never from the first harsh clanging of the bell down the stone
      passages at half-past six to the last leap into bed, jumping as it were
      from a heap of Latin exercises and the cold challenge of Perrin's
      voice as he went round the dormitories turning lights out&mdash;never a
      moment's pause to think about anything extra at all. But he was in
      no way a reflective person. He saw that his own small boys in their
      untidy, scrambling kind of way liked him and that the bigger boys of the
      Upper Fourth, to whom he taught French twice a week, revered him because
      of his football.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masters at the Upper School seemed pleasant fellows, although he
      might, had he thought about it, have perceived dimly an atmosphere of
      unrest and discomfort in their common room.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Moy-Thompson as yet he had had no dealings at all. He had been to
      supper there once on Sunday night, had been appalled by the dreariness of
      the whole affair, the shrivelled ill-temper of Moy-Thompson's
      parents (aged about ninety apiece), the inadequacy of the food, the
      melancholy inertia of Mrs. Moy-Thompson; but he had had no nearer
      relations with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, indeed, already begun to perceive that in his own common room
      things were not quite as they should be. He was always an exceedingly
      equable and easy-tempered person, and he had been surprised at himself on
      several occasions for being irritated at very unimportant and
      insignificant details. There were, for instance, the incidents of the bath
      and the morning papers. Both of these incidents derived their irritation
      from their original connection with Perrin, and this might have led him,
      had he thought about it, to the discovery that he did not like Perrin and
      that Perrin did not like him. But he never dwelt upon things&mdash;he was
      always thinking of the matter immediately in hand, and where there was an
      empty reflective quarter of an hour his eyes were on Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident of the bath was, it might have been thought, inconsiderable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin's bedroom was next to Traill's. Opposite their doors,
      on the other side of the passage, was a bathroom containing two baths. In
      this bathroom Traill always arrived some minutes after Perrin. Try as he
      might, he never succeeded in arriving first. Perrin always filled both
      baths, one with hot and one with cold, and stood moodily, his naked body
      gaunt and bony in the gray light, watching them whilst they filled. Traill
      was forced to wait until Perrin had had both his baths before he could
      have his. At first it had seemed a small matter. Gradually as the days
      passed the irritation grew. There was something in Perrin's
      complacent immobility as he stood above his bath that was of itself
      annoying. Why should a man wait? One morning they rushed out together.
      There were words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Perrin, why not have hot and cold in the same bath?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Traill, it isn't, I should have thought, quite your
      place....&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill sometimes dreamt early in the morning of French exercises, of the
      midday mutton, of Perrin's bony, ugly body watching the bath. If
      Traill had thought about it, he would have seen that Perrin did not like
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident of the morning paper was equally trivial. Dormer always had
      breakfast in his own house, and that left therefore three of them. They
      clubbed together and provided three newspapers&mdash;the <i>Morning Post</i>,
      the <i>Daily Mail</i>, and a local affair. It was obvious that the person
      who came in last was left with the local paper. Perrin generally came in
      last, because he took early prep, in the Upper School, and he expected
      that the <i>Morning Post</i> should be left for him. But Traill, as he
      paid the same subscription as Perrin, did not see why this should be.
      Clinton always took the <i>Daily Mail</i>, and therefore Perrin had to be
      contented with the <i>Cornish News</i>. There was at last an argument.
      Traill refused to give way. The rest of the meal was eaten in absolute
      silence. Perrin came no more to Traill's room for an evening chat&mdash;a
      very small matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the end of the first month Traill did not see these things as in
      any way ominous. He could keep his boys in order. He liked his game of
      football; he was in a glow because he was in love&mdash;moreover, he had
      never quarreled with anyone in his life. He did not know that he had made
      any progress with Isabel. It was very difficult to see her. She came down
      sometimes to watch them play football; after Chapel in the evening, he had
      walked up the little dark lane with her, the stars above the dark, cloudy
      trees, and the leaves a carpet about their feet&mdash;and at every meeting
      he loved her more. When he had spare hours in the afternoon he liked to
      walk to the Brown Wood or down to the sea. Once or twice he bicycled over
      to Pendragon and had tea with the Trojans. Sir Henry Trojan was a man who
      had appealed to him immensely. In spite of his size and strength and
      simplicity, his air of a man who lived out of doors and read little, he
      had a tremendous poetic passion for Cornwall. He showed Traill a great
      many things that were new to him. He began to feel a sense of color; he
      saw the Brown Wood, the twisting, gray-roofed village, the sweeping,
      striving sea with fresh vision. He stopped sometimes in his walks and drew
      a deep breath at the way that the lights and colors were hung about him.
      Of course the contrast of his school life drove these other things against
      him&mdash;and also his love for Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      These little things would have no importance were it not that they all
      helped to blind him to his true relations with Perrin. He did not think
      about Perrin at all; he did not think about his life even in any very
      definite way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never analyzed things; he took things and used them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then at the end of that first month Birkland talked in the most
      amazing way....
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Traill had been attached to Birkland from the first. The man had definite
      personality&mdash;aggressive in its influence&mdash;and contempt of the
      rest of the common room, but they justified it to some extent by their own
      terror of his tongue and their eager criticism of him behind his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had treated Traill like the rest, but then Traill never noticed it. He
      was not afraid of Birkland, he never resented his criticism, and he
      appreciated his humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then suddenly one evening Birkland asked him to come and see him. His
      room was untidy&mdash;littered with school-books, exercise-books, stacks
      of paper to be corrected; but behind this curtain of discomfort there were
      signs of other earlier things: some etchings, dusty and uncared for, sets
      of Meredith and Pater, some photographs, and a large engraving of Whistler's
      portrait of his mother. The latticed window was open, and from the night
      outside, blowing into the gusty candles, there were the scent of decaying
      leaves and a faint breath of the distant sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birkland was thin&mdash;sticks of legs and arms; a short, wiry mustache;
      heavy, overhanging eyebrows; thin, straight, stiff hair turning a little
      gray. He gave Traill a drink, watched him fill a pipe; and then, huddled
      in his armchair, his legs crossed under him, his eyes full on the open
      window and the night sky, he asked Traill questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you like it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;immensely!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;why not? After all, it gives a fellow what he wants.
      There's plenty of exercise&mdash;the hours are healthy&mdash;the
      fellows are quite nice fellows. I like teaching.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill gave a sigh of satisfaction, and, after all, he had omitted his
      principal reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. How long do you mean to stay here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! a year, I suppose. Then I ought to get to Clifton.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You'd better not tell the Head that, though. How do you
      like the other men?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think they 're very good fellows. Dormer's
      splendid.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and Perrin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he's all right. He seems to get annoyed pretty easily. As
      a matter of fact, I have felt rather irritated once or twice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;everyone's wanted to cut Perrin's throat some
      time or other. As a matter of fact, I shouldn't wonder if it was n't
      the other way round&mdash;one day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and then Birkland said, &ldquo;And so you like it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course; don't you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Birkland laughed. There was a long pause. Then Traill said again, rather
      uncertainly, &ldquo;Don't you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never thought of Birkland as an unhappy man&mdash;as a matter of
      fact he never thought of people as being definite kinds of people, and he
      scarcely ever read novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Birkland spoke: &ldquo;You had better not ask me that, young man, if
      you want an encouraging answer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then very slowly, after another pause, the words came out: &ldquo;I'm
      going to speak the truth to you to-night for the good and safety of your
      soul, and I haven't cared for the good and safety of anyone's
      soul for&mdash;well!&mdash;I should be afraid to say how long. I'm
      afraid&mdash;I don't really care very much about the safety of yours&mdash;but
      I care enough to speak to you; and the one thing I say to you is&mdash;get
      out&mdash;get away. Fly for your life.&rdquo; His voice sank to a whisper.
      &ldquo;If you don't, you will die very soon&mdash;in a year perhaps.
      We are all dead here, and we died a great many years ago.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill moved uncomfortably in his chair. He smiled across the flickering
      candles at Birkland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I say,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that's a bit of
      exaggeration, isn't it? I suppose one is tired sometimes, of course;
      but, after all, there are a good many men in the country who make a pretty
      good thing out of mastering and are n't so very miserable.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evident that he thought that it was all a kind of joke on Birkland's
      part. He pulled contentedly at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other man went on: &ldquo;I shouldn't have said this at all
      if I hadn't meant it, and if I hadn't got twenty years of
      experience behind me to prove what I say. I don't know why I'm
      bothering you, I'm sure; but now I've begun I'm going
      on, and you've got to listen. You can't say you haven't
      been given your chance. Have you ever looked round the common room and
      seen what kind of men they are?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Traill; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he added
      modestly, &ldquo;I'm not observant, you know. I'm not at all a
      clever kind of chap.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you would have seen what I'm telling you written in
      their faces right enough. Mind you&mdash;what I'm saying to you
      doesn't apply to the first-class public school. That's a
      different kind of thing altogether. I'm talking about places like
      Moffatt's&mdash;places that are trying to be what they are not&mdash;to
      do what they can't do&mdash;to get higher than they can reach. There
      are thousands of them all over the country&mdash;places where the men are
      underpaid, with no prospects, herded together, all of them hating each
      other, wanting, perhaps, towards the end of term, to cut each other's
      throats. Do you suppose that that is good for the boys they teach?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused and relit his pipe, and his voice was, too, measured, but
      showing in its tensity his emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a different thing with the bigger places. There, there
      is more room; the men don't live so close together; they are paid
      better; there is a chance of getting a house; there is the <i>esprit de
      corps</i> of the school... but here, my God!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Birkland bent forward, his face white, over the candles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of it, Traill, you fool! You say, in a year's time.
      Don't I know that? Do you suppose that I meant to stay here for ever
      when I came? But one postpones moving. Another term will be better, or you
      try for a thing, fail, and get discouraged... and then suddenly you are
      too old&mdash;too old at thirty-three&mdash;earning two hundred a year...
      too old! and liable to be turned out with a week's notice if the
      Head doesn't like you&mdash;turned out with nothing to go to; and he
      knows that you are afraid of him and he has games with you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill stared at the little man's burning eyes. How odd of Birkland
      to talk like this!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you will escape, but already the place has its fingers
      about you. You will be a different man at the end of the term. You will be
      allowed no friends here, only enemies. You think the rest of us like you.
      Well, for a moment perhaps, but only for a moment. Soon something will
      come... already you dislike Perrin. You must not be friends with the Head,
      because then we shall think that you are spying on us. You must not be
      friends with us, because then the Head will hear of it and will
      immediately hate you because he will think that you are conspiring against
      him. You must not be friends with the boys, because then we shall all hate
      you and they will despise you. You will be quite alone. You think that you
      are going to teach with freshness and interest&mdash;you are full of eager
      plans, new ideas. Every plan, every idea, will be immediately killed. You
      must not have them&mdash;they are not good for examinations&mdash;you are
      trying to show that you are superior.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Birkland paused. Traill moved uneasily in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait! You must hear me out. It all goes deeper than these things.
      It is murder&mdash;self-murder. You are going to kill&mdash;you have got
      to kill&mdash;every fine thought, every hope, that you possess. You will
      be laughed at for your ambitions, your desires. You will not even be
      allowed any fine vices. You must never go anywhere, because you are
      neglecting your work. You have no time. Here we are&mdash;fifteen men&mdash;all
      hating each other, loathing everything that the other man does&mdash;the
      way he eats, the way he moves, the way he teaches. We sleep next door to
      each other, we eat together, we meet all day until late at night&mdash;hating
      each other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said Traill, still smiling, &ldquo;it is only a
      month or two, and there are holidays.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If term lasted another week or two,&rdquo; went on Birkland
      quietly, &ldquo;murder would be committed. The holidays come, and you go
      out into the world to find that you are different from all other men&mdash;to
      find that they know that you are different. You are patronizing, narrow,
      egotistic. You realize it slowly; you see them shunning you&mdash;and then
      back you go again. God knows, they should not hate us&mdash;these others!
      they should pity us. If you marry, see what it is&mdash;look at Mrs.
      Dormer, Mrs. Comber, Mrs. Moy-Thompson. Look at their husbands, their
      life. There is marriage&mdash;no money, no prospects, perhaps in the end
      starvation! And gradually there creeps over you a dreadful and horrible
      inertia: you do not care&mdash;you do not think&mdash;you are a ghost. If
      one of us dies, we do not mind&mdash;we do not think about it. Only,
      towards the end of the term, when the examinations come, there creeps
      about the place a new devil. All our nerve is gone; our hatred of each
      other begins to be active. It is the end-of-termy devil.... Another week
      or two, and there is no knowing what we might do. We are all tired,
      horribly tired. Be careful then what you do and what you say.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; said Traill, filling his pipe, &ldquo;what a
      horrible picture of things! You must be out of sorts. Why, it's
      hysteria!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Birkland had crawled back into his chair again. He puffed at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! of course you don't see it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After
      all, why should you? But it's true, every word of it. Oh! I'm
      resigned enough now. Besides, it's the beginning of the term. I'm
      inclined to think it's untrue, myself, just now. Wait and see. Watch
      White after he's had an interview with the Head&mdash;see Perrin and
      Comber together later on&mdash;study Mrs. Comber. But don't you
      bother. You won't listen to me&mdash;why should you? Only, in ten
      years' time you 'll remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that they talked of other things. Birkland was rather amusing in his
      sharp, caustic way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Traill as he stood by the door on the way out,
      &ldquo;that was all rot; was n't it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was?&rdquo; asked Birkland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, about the place&mdash;this place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All rot!&rdquo; said Birkland gravely.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      But of course one dismisses these things very soon&mdash;especially, and
      immediately, if the person in question is Archie Traill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why think about a problematic and depressing forty? Take these men that
      Birkland so gloomily points to as disappointing and unsatisfactory
      exceptions. Life is like that. There are always the riders who collapse
      into ditches and sit there mumbling, wishing for the company, down in the
      dirt and the grime, of their fellow-horsemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there is this fine autumn weather. Birkland remains a crabbed
      shadow; life is sharp, pungent&mdash;formed with faint blue skies, dim and
      shining like clear glass with a hard yellow sun stuck like a tethered
      balloon between saucer-clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Archie Traill, on a free afternoon&mdash;an early frost had made the
      ground too hard for football&mdash;in the week after that Birkland
      evening, stood in the village street as the church clock struck half-past
      three, and he thanked God for a half-holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air was so still that the distant mining stamps and the breaking sea
      had it for the plain of their unceasing war, cannon against cannon, and
      the withdrawing rattle of their rival shot echoing against the blue
      horizon and the stiff side of the Brown Hill. The village cobbles shone
      and glittered; the gray roofs lay like carpets spread to dry. The brown
      church tower seemed to sway&mdash;so motionless was the rest of the world&mdash;with
      the clatter of its chiming clocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Isabel Desart turned the corner. &ldquo;Good afternoon, Mr.
      Traill,&rdquo; and the clasp of her hand was strong and clean as all the
      rest of her movements. She smiled at him as she always smiled, a little
      ironically and also a little seriously, as though she found the world a
      strange place, ought to think it a solemn one, but couldn't help
      finding it funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three old women, their skirts kilted about them, their eyes fixed on
      vacancy, flung their voices into the silence like balls against a board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she only sixteen&mdash;what a size!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only sixteen!&mdash;to think of it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With her great legs and all!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only sixteen...!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The man and woman moved up the road together. She was usually so full of
      things to say that her silence surprised him. The thought that his
      presence could possibly be agitating to her, and therefore responsible,
      drove the blood to his head, and then he rebuked himself for a
      presumptuous fool. But if he had spoken, he would have had to tell her
      that he loved her&mdash;and it was n't time yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last he broke against the silence very quietly. &ldquo;We must
      talk, one of us&mdash;it is so wonderfully quiet that it's alarming.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned round to him, and suddenly, so that he stopped in the road and
      looked at her, she put her hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are both so frightfully young,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he said, laughing at her; &ldquo;but why not?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, for the things that we 'll have to do. You for the boys,
      and I for my poor Mrs. Comber. I had thought when I saw you first that you
      were going to be old enough, but I don't think you are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that I can't&mdash;&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! it isn't for anything that you <i>can't</i> do!&rdquo;
      she broke in. &ldquo;It's just because you don't see it&mdash;why
      should you? You 're too much in the middle&mdash;I suppose it's
      only outsiders who can really understand. But I get so depressed sometimes
      with it all that I think that I will leave it and go back to London and
      never come here again. One doesn't seem to be any use&mdash;no use
      at all. And it all seems worse in the autumn somehow. Poor Mr. Traill! I
      always happen to be gloomy when you catch me, and I'm not gloomy
      really in the least.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what is it all about? And don't go to London, please. You
      mustn't think of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so much in earnest that she turned and looked at him. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
      she said gravely. &ldquo;Do you like my being here?&rdquo; And then,
      before he could say anything, she added, reflectively, &ldquo;Well, that's
      one, at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have to go in here,&rdquo; she said, stopping before a gate with
      a drive behind it. &ldquo;Tea, you understand.&rdquo; Then she gave him
      her hand. &ldquo;Although you don't in the least know what I mean,
      you 're a help,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and I shall look across the
      chapel floor in the evening and know that I have a friend. Sometimes when
      I'm down here&mdash;out of it&mdash;and everything's so fresh
      and clear, like to-night, I think that it can't be true&mdash;the
      things that go on. Oh! I'm so sorry for them, all of them.&rdquo;
      She went through the gate and looked back at him. &ldquo;But I don't
      want to have to be sorry for you as well&mdash;please,&rdquo; she added,
      and was lost in the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he, in his triumphant, buoyant sensation of things having moved a step&mdash;or
      even a good many steps further&mdash;was ready that she should be sorry or
      have any sensation whatever so long as she thought of him. Her claiming
      Chapel-time as a meeting-ground made that somewhat irritating and so
      swiftly recurrent a ceremonial a thrice-blessed moment to which he might
      eagerly look forward throughout the day. But it is not my intention to
      give you all his symptoms&mdash;his passion is in no way the chief point;
      it was simply one of the things that helped in the culminating issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel, meanwhile, found that throughout the tea-party her little
      conversation with Traill ran in her head. It was not a very interesting
      tea-party&mdash;three old ladies who regarded her as something very
      dangerous and alarming and offered her cake as though they expected it to
      turn into a bomb in her hands. She looked at their comfortable fire, their
      dark, cozy drawing-room, their caps and shawls, with the eye of someone
      whose passage through that country was very swift and whose language was
      not theirs. The dancing glow of the firelight, the tinkle of the
      tea-things, the softness of the rugs at her feet, were not the expression
      of her idea of life, and she flung them away from her and thought of
      Moffatt's and the night outside. Throughout their soft and courteous
      speech her mind was with Traill. He had said, &ldquo;Don't go to
      London, please,&rdquo; and he had meant it&mdash;it was almost as though
      he had appealed to her from a sudden vision that he had of all that was in
      front of him. <i>She</i> knew, of course&mdash;she had seen it happen so
      very often before; and perceived that for this man, too, with his bright,
      eager challenge of life, his absurdly young notion of the way that things
      would be certain to be simple when they were never simple at all, grim,
      baffling disappointment was at hand. To her those red walls of Moffatt's
      were alive, moving&mdash;crushing, as in some story that she had once
      read, relentlessly the victims that were hidden within. Perhaps he had
      suddenly seen or understood something of that&mdash;there had come to him
      some forewarning. Her cheek reddened at the thought and her breath came
      quickly. She liked him&mdash;she had liked him from the first&mdash;she
      liked him very much; and if he wanted her to help him, she would do all
      that she could. She said good-by to the three old ladies and left them
      behind her with a little humorous laugh. It was right that there should be
      three old ladies living like that, so cozily and comfortably, with their
      fires and their carpets, at the very foot of Moffatt's. How little
      people realized! These old ladies with their park gates and long drive!
      How they would roll up in their carriage!... and the Moffatt's!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was dark, and the long hill that stretched above her was black and
      ominous. The lights of Moffatt's showed, to the right at the top,
      and the darker shape of its buildings cut the lighter gray of the sky.
      There was a lamp-post at the corner of the road, and as she closed the
      gates behind her with a clang she heard a voice say, &ldquo;Good evening,
      Miss Desart,&rdquo; and saw that Mr. Perrin was at her side. Mr. Perrin
      always made her feel nervous, and now, in the dark, she instinctively
      shrank back, but it was only for an instant, and she was immediately
      ashamed of her fears. She could not see his face, but she fancied that his
      voice trembled&mdash;-he seemed troubled about something; and then that
      feeling of pity that she had for him before came upon her again, and her
      voice was softer and more tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was&mdash;um&mdash;a great piece of good fortune for me that I
      should be passing just when you were coming out&mdash;a great piece of
      good fortune.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed very nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And for me too,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;this hill grows
      extraordinarily dark, and I stayed on longer than I ought to have done.
      Have you been paying calls, too?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! I&mdash;um&mdash;never pay calls&mdash;merely a stroll down
      to the village to buy some tobacco&mdash;merely that&mdash;nothing more...
      yes, merely that... simply some tobacco.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt his agitation, and wished that the top of the hill might be
      reached as speedily as possible, but she fancied a little that he
      lingered. She hastened her steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure that it is n't raining&mdash;I felt a drop
      just now, I thought&mdash;and it was such a lovely afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I assure you&mdash;&rdquo; and then he suddenly stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was frightened&mdash;quite unreasonably. She wanted to reach the
      warmth and light of Mrs. Comber's drawing-room as soon as possible
      and escape from this strange, awkward man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke the silence. &ldquo;How is Mr. Traill getting on at the Lower
      School? I hope you all like him. The boys seem to have taken to him; but
      then, of course, his football is a quick road to favor.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin seemed to be swallowing his teeth. He coughed and choked.
      &ldquo;Ah, well, yes, Traill&mdash;young, of course, young, and one can
      only learn by experience. Perhaps just a little inclined to be cock-sure&mdash;dangerous
      thing to be too certain&mdash;a fault of youth, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've found him,&rdquo; said Isabel, &ldquo;very modest
      and pleasant. Of course, I haven't seen very much of him, but I must
      say that what I 've seen of him I've liked.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They were nearly at the top of the hill; the big black gates cut the
      horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the light of the lamps at the corner of the road Isabel saw Mr. Perrin's
      face. It looked very white under the gaslight, and he was clenching and
      unclenching his hands. His cap was on one side, his tie had risen at the
      back above his collar... his eyes were looking into hers and beseeching
      her like the eyes of a dumb animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Desart...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They both came to a halt in the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said, smiling at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to... I'd be awfully glad one day if...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped again desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; she said, still smiling at him. He looked so
      odd, standing there in the dark, silent road... his hands restless. His
      eyes had moved from her face and were gazing up the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would be so glad if&mdash;one day&mdash;so flattered if&mdash;you
      would&mdash;will&mdash;um&mdash;come for a walk, one day.&rdquo; He
      stopped with a jerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved through the gate and looked back at him before turning up the
      path to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, Mr. Perrin, I shall be delighted. Good night.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood looking after her.

      CHAPTER V&mdash;A GAME OF FOOTBALL AND A DANCE IN PENDRAGON HAVE THEIR

    <h3>
      I.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ATER there is Mr.
      Perrin heavily&mdash;with the midday mutton close about his head&mdash;surveying,
      in his dingy and tattered sitting-room, four small boys who gaze at him
      with staring eyes and jumping throats.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a piece of English poetry that has brought them, miserably, by the
      ears&mdash;Browning's &ldquo;Patriot,&rdquo; one verse a week, to be
      said every Tuesday morning first hour, and to be forgotten eagerly,
      completely forgotten, every Tuesday morning second hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      I go in the rain and, more than needs
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The rope&mdash;the rope&mdash;the rope&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson Minor gazed miserably at his companions and, finding no help in
      man, but only a jesting glory at his misfortunes, dizzily, despairingly,
      to the top row of Mr. Perrin's bookcase, where <i>Advanced Algebra
      and Mensuration</i> hold perpetual war and rivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a desperate affair altogether, because it was the afternoon of a
      football match&mdash;a great football match against a mighty Truro team,&mdash;and
      already the gathering multitude in the field below flung a derisive murmur
      at the dusty panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Perrin was motionless. He offered no assistance, he suggested no
      remedy, he merely tapped with his bone paper-knife on the red tablecloth&mdash;a
      tap that showed Johnson Minor once and for all that his case was hopeless:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A rope&mdash;a rope that&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson Minor, with hanging head and red eyes, passed out to write it, the
      whole poem, fifty times before lock-up. He would miss the match. Outside,
      in the passage, he suddenly remembered the whole verse clearly, perfectly;
      but it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last one prisoner only remained&mdash;Garden Minimus, a cheerful,
      untidy person aged ten, in enormous boots and no kind of parting to his
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garden Minimus was the boy whom Perrin liked best in the whole school&mdash;had
      liked him best for the last two years. When things were really black, when
      headaches were violent, and when unpopularity seemed to hang about him in
      a dense, thick cloud, there was always Garden Minimus. He flattered
      himself that the boy was not aware of this partiality; but the boy, he was
      sure, liked him. He treated him always with an elaborate irony that the
      boy seemed to understand in some curious way. Garden would stand, with his
      head on one side like a rather intelligent small dog, and although he
      rarely said anything more than &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; or &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo;
      Perrin felt that he grasped the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this afternoon it was plain that Garden Minimus did not know a word of
      &ldquo;The Patriot,&rdquo; and had made no attempt whatever to learn it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin looked at him with a slow smile. &ldquo;I'm afraid,
      friend Garden,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it will devolve upon your
      lordship&mdash;hum&mdash;ha&mdash;that you should write this poem of the
      noble Mr. Robert Browning's no less than fifty times. I grieve&mdash;I
      sympathize&mdash;I am your humble servant; but the law commands.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Garden Minimus brushed Mr. Perrin's fine periods aside, and said,
      with a most engaging smile, &ldquo;There's a most ripping footer
      match this afternoon, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool though I am,&rdquo; said Mr. Perrin, &ldquo;I have
      nevertheless observed that there is, as you say, a footer match.
      Nevertheless, I am afraid 'The Patriot' calls you, friend
      Garden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be an awful pity,&rdquo; said Garden reflectively, without
      paying the slightest attention to Mr. Perrin, &ldquo;to miss a decent game
      like that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Mr. Perrin was irritated. He snapped out sharply, &ldquo;All
      right, Garden; that will do. You 'll get it a hundred times if you
      aren't careful!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Garden, realizing his defeat, moved slowly out of the room, his forehead
      lowering. Outside the door he muttered, &ldquo;Silly, pompous ass!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin remained discontented, unhappy. He was continually attempting
      to make the boys fond of him and at the same time to retain his dignity.
      He never succeeded in this, because so definite an attempt on his part
      immediately precluded any capitulation on theirs. They thought he was a
      fool to try, and they resented his airs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was really fond of Garden Minimus, he thought, as he sat with his head
      between his arms in his dingy, dusty room. The dust wove patterns above
      his head in the pale, dim sunlight. He must go down and watch the
      football. He must get out amongst people, because he had a sickening fear
      that for the first time that term his headaches were coming back to him.
      He had avoided them. Miss Desart had been there instead, and every time
      that she spoke to him he had felt well and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had spoken to him a good many times lately, and he now was sure that
      she was attracted to him. Soon he would ask her to go with him for a
      walk... then there would be more walks... then.... He wrote to his mother
      that the thing was practically arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for that puppy, Traill&mdash;well, he 'd kept him in his place,
      thank Heaven. As the days increased, Perrin had grown to dislike him more
      and more&mdash;conceited, insufferable, giving himself such airs. When he
      met anyone who gave himself airs, Perrin had a curious habit of referring
      things back to his old mother and seeing her insulted. He could see the
      patronizing way that Traill would speak to her. This always made him
      furiously angry when he thought of it. But being furiously angry only
      brought on his headaches again. Oh! there were things to be done! He
      looked around his room and saw a pile of mathematical papers, some English
      essays. His eye crossed to the mantelpiece, and he saw there a silly china
      figure, painted in red and yellow, of an old gentleman in a cocked hat.
      This, for no reason that he could explain, always irritated him. The old
      gentleman had so confident and knowing a smile. He had always meant to get
      rid of it, but for some reason or other he never could destroy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! he must get out into the air! His head was very had.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he left his room, there was a vague fear, somewhere, at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The game had begun. The ropes on either side were thickly lined with a
      dark crowd of boys, and a long wailing shout, &ldquo;Scho-o-l!&rdquo; rose
      and fell without ceasing. Perrin, in his shabby greatcoat, watched with a
      superior but interested air. There was nothing in the world that excited
      him more, but he had never been able to play himself and so he affected to
      despise it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of him, pressed against the rope, were three small boys of his
      own house, each boy holding a paper bag from which he drew fat and sticky
      green and brown sweets. They had not noticed him. They divided their
      attention between their neighbors, their sweets, and the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, Huggins, you silly fool! What are you shoving for?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help it&mdash;Grey's barging&mdash;Oh! I say, run
      it, Morton. That's it! Pick it up&mdash;dodge him, man! Oh, hang it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, swop one of those brown things for one of mine&mdash;Thanks!
      Where's Garden, you chaps?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Swotting up for Old Pompous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! what rot! I'm blowed if I would. I thought Pompous was
      rather sweet on Garden.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is&mdash;but Garden can't stand him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder&mdash;blithering ass, with his long words!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I say&mdash;they 've got it! There's Morton off
      again&mdash;Oh! he's going! Well run, my word! He's in! No, he
      isn't! The back's got him! No, he hasn't! Hurray! Try!
      Good old Morton!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the commotion that followed the happy event Perrin moved to a less
      crowded portion of the people. He was accustomed to hearing himself spoken
      of with but little respect by those who, when he was present, trembled
      before him. He always told himself that all the members of the staff were
      in the same box; but this afternoon it hurt&mdash;it hurt badly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little beasts! He'd punish them! As he moved along behind the ranks
      of boys&mdash;each boy with his friend&mdash;the familiar mantle of
      loneliness, that he had known so long, swept him in its somber folds. He
      saw Comber in the distance, turned to avoid him, and suddenly confronted
      Mrs. Comber and Miss Desart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pulled himself up with a sudden effort of one who, feeling at his very
      worst, has immediately to appear at his very best, and the struggle was
      glaring to the observer, in the nervous clutching of the buttons of his
      coat and his uneasy, agitated laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber was always at her noisiest and most affable with Mr. Perrin,
      because she didn't like him, and she always tried to cover that
      dislike with an increased amiability. Isabel stood rather gravely by and
      watched the game.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We appear to be winning,&rdquo; said Perrin, glaring as he spoke at
      three small hoys who had looked up at the sound of his voice. &ldquo;We
      appear&mdash;um&mdash;to be winning. Morton has secured a try.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm so glad,&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Comber&mdash;she was out
      of breath. &ldquo;Morton's a nice boy&mdash;we had him once in our
      house, and I do hope the school will win, because it's so nice for
      everybody's tempers, and the boys like it&mdash;and there's
      that nice Mr. Traill playing and running about most beautifully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin started. He hadn't noticed that Traill was playing. He looked
      at Isabel and saw that she was watching the game with deep attention.
      Traill was certainly in his element. The ball came suddenly in his
      direction. He had it in his hands and was off with it. There was a
      breathless, hushed pause; then, as he sped along, just inside the
      touch-line, swerved past his opposing three-quarter to the center of the
      field, and flew for the goal, the silence broke into a roar. Miss Desart
      gave a long-drawn &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Mrs. Comber a little scream, Mr.
      Perrin moodily stroked his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      The back was outwitted, and came floundering to the ground&mdash;a very
      pretty try.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good old Traillers!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's something like!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't he spiffing?&rdquo;&mdash;and then Miss Desart's,
      &ldquo;Oh! that was splendid!&rdquo; beat about Mr. Perrin's poor
      head, that was aching horribly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That nice Mr. Traill! I do like to see people run like that. Oh! it's
      half-time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber caught Mr. Perrin slowly into her vision again and prepared
      once more to be volubly pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Perrin had had enough. On the opposite side of the field, on the
      top of the hill against the china white of the autumn sky, were three
      trees, gnarled, bent, gaunt, like three old men. Quite alone they stood
      and watched, impersonally and gravely, the game. Mr. Perrin felt suddenly
      as though he, too, were really one of them. Behind them sheets of white
      light, falling from the hidden sun, flooded the long, brown fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cold pale blue was reflected against the gray stodgy clouds. Mr. Perrin
      went back slowly to his room. The dusty untidiness of it closed about him.
      He sat down to his pile of English essays on &ldquo;Town and Country&mdash;Which
      is the best to live in?&rdquo; with a confused sense of running men,
      lights across the hills, the china red and black man on the mantelpiece,
      and Miss Desart's shining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o'clock, with a heavy scowl, Garden Minimus presented
      &ldquo;The Patriot&rdquo; neatly written fifty times.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was about this time that Archie Traill accepted an invitation to a
      dance at Sir Henry Trojan's. It was to be only a small dance, and it
      was to be over by twelve. &ldquo;Do let us,&rdquo; Lady Trojan wrote,
      &ldquo;put you up. You will be able to see more of Robin, who is coming
      down for the night from London. He will want to see you so badly.&rdquo;
      Traill wrote back, accepting the dance, but explaining that he must return
      on the same evening, quoting as his imperative necessity early morning
      preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Clinton's evening on duty, and therefore there was no very
      obvious necessity to say anything more about it; but Traill, in order to
      free himself from any further danger, thought that he would go and receive
      definite permission from Moy-Thompson. He had not as yet been to a single
      dinner or evening party outside the school, and he had noticed that the
      rest of the staff never went out at all, nor had apparently any intention
      of doing so. He went round at twelve o'clock after morning school to
      Moy-Thompson's study, knocked on the door, and entered. He was
      conscious at once of trouble in the air. He saw that White, the nervous
      man who took the Classical Fifth, was standing by Thompson's table.
      He moved back as though he would leave the room; but the headmaster called
      to him, &ldquo;Ah! Traill, don't go. I shall be ready in a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Traill noticed several things. He noticed, first, that Moy-Thompson's
      garden beyond the window was colored a brilliant brown in the sun; he
      noticed that Moy-Thompson's study was dark and black, like a prison;
      he noticed that White's long hatchet-face was yellow in the
      half-light; he noticed that both White's hands, hanging straight at
      his side, were tightly clenched, and that his thin legs, spread widely
      apart, were drawn tight beneath his trousers so that the cloth flapped a
      little against his thin calves; he noticed that Moy-Thompson's long
      gray beard swept the table and that his fingers tapped the wood every now
      and again with the sound of peas rattling on a plate; he noticed that
      Moy-Thompson was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moy-Thompson said, &ldquo;But I think I told you that Maurice was on no
      account to have an exeat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White's voice came from a far, hesitating distance: &ldquo;Yes, I
      know. But his father was only to be in London for an hour, and he has not
      seen his son for a year, and I thought that under the circumstances&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That does not alter the fact that I had expressed a wish that he
      should not have an exeat.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;but I thought that if you knew all the circumstances of
      the case, you would not object.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your position here? Are you here to consider my wishes?
      What are you paid to do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      White made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course if you are dissatisfied with the condition of things
      here, you have only to say so. It would be doubtless possible to fill your
      place.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo;&mdash;White's voice was very low&mdash;&ldquo;I
      have no complaint. I am sorry if&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember your position here. I have yet to discover any
      paid position that enables you to indulge your own particular fancies when
      you please. Doubtless you are better informed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill could endure it no longer. He was so angry that the blood had
      rushed to his head, and his face was scarlet. White had flung one glance
      at him, as though to beseech him to go away, and he moved to the door; but
      again Moy-Thompson said, &ldquo;Just a moment, Traill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so angry that, on the impulse of the moment, he had almost stepped
      across the room and flung in his resignation. White's long haggard
      figure was torture; it was cruelty, devilish cruelty, laughing with them
      there in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man at the table was playing with them as a cat does with a mouse,
      shaming one of them before the younger man, as though he had stripped him
      naked and driven him so into the playing-fields outside, forcing the other
      to listen, brutally, intolerably, against his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room seemed full of pain&mdash;it seemed to cross and recross in
      waves. White's head bent down.... At last he passed with lowered
      eyes out through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill could not speak; without another word, he turned and followed him.
      Outside the door in the darkened passage he suddenly held out his hand and
      caught White's. White held his for an instant; suddenly, with a
      frightened, startled look, he stepped away.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the evening of the dance arrived, Traill noticed that he was glad to
      get away. Term had now lasted for six weeks, and in another week it would
      be half-term. He was a little tired; he found it more difficult to get up
      in the morning. Little things mattered a great deal&mdash;he now
      emphatically disliked Perrin more than he had ever disliked anyone in his
      life before; there was even annoyance in the mere sight of his long, lean,
      untidy figure, in the sound of his assured, supercilious voice, in the
      sense of his arrogance.
    </p>
    <p>
      They never spoke to each other if they could help it; meals were extremely
      disagreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found, too, that love did not mingle properly with school work. He was
      always going into day-dreams when he should have been teaching his form.
      He tried to keep the sea and the wood and the funny man that he had met
      there and Isabel apart from his work; but they came skipping in&mdash;and
      at night he dreamt&mdash;he was almost sure that she loved him....
      Whenever they met now they were very silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He escaped whilst they were all in chapel. He lit his bicycle-lamp,
      wrapped a long, thin coat about him, and escaped. It had been a cold, fine
      day. The sun was just setting over the sea as he spun down the hard, white
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he flew between the dark, sweet-scented hedges, as he felt the wind in
      his ears and about his face, as the smell, salt and sharp, of the sea came
      to him, it was strange to find how the cares and troubles of those brown
      buildings on the hill fled away from him. He was already his old self; he
      sang to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faint red glow hovered over the dark, heaving water; the trees stood
      black on the horizon, and the long, low lines of shadow, white and gray,
      stole about the road as the evening sky slowly settled, with a little
      sighing of the wind, into the colors that it would bear during the night.
      The lights of the little village behind him made a red cluster against the
      dark shoulder of the Brown Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sang aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a most enjoyable dance; he had never enjoyed a dance so much
      before. He realized that he, was looking on the past six weeks as
      imprisonment; he also noticed that when he told his partners that he was a
      schoolmaster they stared at him a little apprehensively. It was delightful
      to see Robin Trojan again. They walked into the garden and strolled about
      the paths together; he was much improved since the Cambridge days, Traill
      thought&mdash;less self-assured and with wider interests. And then Sir
      Henry Trojan always gave Traill a broader feeling of life&mdash;sanity and
      health and strength&mdash;and lie had an admirable sense of humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then it was over, and Traill was speeding back over the hill again. He
      thought of Isabel all the way back. He fancied that she was with him in
      the dark. The night was so black that he could only see the little round
      white circle that his lamp flung on the road in front of him. The hedges,
      like black, bulging pillows, closed him in.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to be back in no time. He heard the school clock strike one. He
      took the Yale key and fitted it into the door; it would not move; he
      tugged, pulled it out, forced it in again, and pushed it. With a click it
      broke in half.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the big, black, silent buildings in despair&mdash;supposing
      he had to stay out all night. He would die rather than ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went round to the other side of the building and looked up. Then he saw
      that the dining-room windows were not very high and that he might climb.
      He caught on to a buttress and pulled himself up; then another hand on the
      window-sill drew him level.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found to his delight that the window was not latched. He pushed it up,
      and then, with one hasty look into the dark cavern beneath him, jumped. He
      was saluted on his descent with a noise as though all the crockery in the
      world had fallen about his ears. The sharp collapse of it seemed to go
      rushing through the silent house for hours; he knew that he had cut his
      hand and had bruised his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he was stunned; then slowly he realized what he had done: the
      tables were laid for the next morning's breakfast, and he had jumped
      down straight amongst the cups and plates.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up on the floor and began, with his head aching, to staunch the
      blood that came from the cut. He saw, as in a dream, the door open.
      Someone was standing there, in a nightshirt, holding a candle; it was
      Perrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's there? What's that?&rdquo; Perrin held a poker in
      his other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill got up slowly from the floor. &ldquo;It is I&mdash;Traill,&rdquo;
      he stammered. He was still feeling stunned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin held the candle a little closer. &ldquo;Oh, is it you, Traill?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have been out. I fell on to the plates and things. I am
      sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made a great noise.&rdquo; Perrin was speaking very slowly.
      &ldquo;You woke me up.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I am most awfully sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill moved towards the door. Perrin still stood there, holding his
      candle, his nightshirt flapping about his legs. He did not seem inclined
      to move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made a great noise. It is one o'clock.&rdquo; He said it
      as though he were Robespierre condemning Louis XVI to execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. I'm dreadfully sorry. I broke my key.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Perrin did not move. &ldquo;What are you doing out so late?&rdquo;
      he said at last, slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the devil had it to do with Perrin!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did n't know that this was a girls' school,&rdquo;
      Traill said at last, sarcastically. His head was aching, his knee hurt, he
      was tired, and in a very bad temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin moved from the door. &ldquo;It's struck one&mdash;coming in
      like this!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The candle flung a most ridiculous shadow of him on the wall&mdash;a huge,
      gigantic head with hair sticking out of it like spears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because he was tired and rather hysterical, this suddenly amused Traill
      enormously. He hurst into a peal of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it,&rdquo; he said, shaking; &ldquo;you look so
      funny, so frightfully odd!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin said nothing. He looked at him for a moment. He had been disturbed
      in his sleep; he had every reason to be very angry. But he said nothing at
      all. He moved slowly down the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill followed him in silence; he was suddenly frightened.

      CHAPTER VI&mdash;SÆVA INDIGNATIO
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O Perrin, in his
      sleep that night there came, accompanied with roaring wind and crashing
      sea, a dream of the little man in red and black china that lived on the
      mantelpiece. He came tip-tap across the floor to him and bent over the bed
      and whispered in his ear. He had grown in his transit and was large in the
      leg and trailed behind him a long black gown, and he troubled Mr. Perrin
      by buzzing like a wasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was urging Perrin to do something, but it was hard to distinguish the
      words because of the booming of the sea. The cold light of early morning
      and, an hour later, the harsh clang of the bell down the stone passages,
      restored the china gentleman once more to the mantelpiece; but the
      discovery that there had been a storm in the night only seemed to confirm
      the gentleman's appearance. Besides, he was no new thing&mdash;he
      had climbed down from his perch on other occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin and Traill exchanged no word during breakfast.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Garden Minimus played his small part in the whole affair by being sulky
      and obstinate during the whole of first hour. It was a game that he was
      perfectly accustomed to playing, and he knew every move from the opening
      gambit of &ldquo;saying things under your breath that looked bad, but
      couldn't possibly be heard,&rdquo; to the triumphant checkmate of a
      studied, sarcastic politeness that was most unusual and hinted at danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin had slept, as we have seen, exceedingly badly, and the old
      hallucination that twenty boys were in reality five hundred crept over
      him. They sat in stupid, irritated rows at hard wooden desks soiled with
      ink. Beyond the drab windows the wind howled, and the dry leaves blew
      against the panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His temper rose as the hour advanced. The fifth proposition of the first
      book of Euclid was scarcely calculated to show dull boys at their
      brightest and best, and Perrin found that, by changing the letters of the
      figure on the board, the form knew nothing about it at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proceeded, as was his way, to secure the dullest, fattest, and heaviest
      boy (a youngster with spectacles and a protruding chin, called
      Somerset-Walpole) and to make merry at his expense. Somerset-Walpole&mdash;his
      fingers exuded ink, his coat whitewash, and his hair dust&mdash;stood with
      his mouth open and his brow wrinkled, and a vague wonder as to why, when
      he ought to be thinking about Euclid, his mind would invariably wander to
      the bristly hairs at the back of Mr. Perrin's neck and the silly
      leaves dancing about outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin played heavily with him for about quarter of an hour (the form
      laughing nervously at his ironical sallies), and then sent the youngster
      back, crying, to his seat; the boy spent the rest of the hour in drawing
      hideous people with noses like pens and tiny legs, and then smudging them
      out with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Perrin had Garden Minimus in his hands. The boy's sulking,
      frowning face drove him to fury. He suddenly felt (as though it had leapt
      wildly from some dark corner on to his shoulder) the Cat of Cruelty
      purring at his ear. It was an animal whose whispers he heard, as a rule,
      only when the term was well advanced; now it was upon him. He knew,
      suddenly, that he would like to take Garden Minimus's ears in his
      hands and twist them back further and further until they cracked. He would
      like to take his little fat arms and close his fingers about them and
      pinch them until they were blue. He would like to take the sharp, white
      knuckles and beat them with a ruler. Garden had chubby cheeks and bright
      blue eyes. Perrin began to pull, very gently, his hair. Garden wriggled a
      little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the triangle A B C,&rdquo; he began, and stopped. Perrin began
      to pinch the back of his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have said that six times now, Garden. Say it again, because I
      am sure the rest of the form are immensely interested. Really, I grieve to
      think of the amount of time that you must have spent over your preparation
      last night. You 'll be overdoing it if you go on like this, you know&mdash;you
      will, really. You mustn't work so hard. Meanwhile write it out
      thirty times, and say it to me to-night after tea.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not let him go. He passed his hand down the boy's arm....
      He saw the form watching him with white faces; his own was white; he was
      shaking with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go back to your seat,&rdquo; he said in a whisper, and he gave him
      a push. He sent the form back to learn the work again, and he sat for the
      rest of the hour with his head between his hands. Then, when the bell had
      rung and most of the form had filed out, he called Garden to him. &ldquo;I
      think fifteen times will be enough,&rdquo; and he touched the boy's
      sleeve with his hand. But Garden went out of the room in silence, infinite
      contempt in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the hoys gone, Mr. Perrin's mind went back to the incident of
      the preceding night. It was his custom to go and talk for a little to
      Moy-Thompson once a week. They disliked each other, of course; but they
      could be of mutual advantage, and they both found that hints dropped and
      accepted during these little talks were of great value during the days
      that followed. Perrin had never any deliberate intention of harming anyone
      in these little conversations. But, every man's hand being against
      him, it seemed to him only fair that he should use such opportunities of
      retaliation as were given him. At the same time these little confidential
      talks flattered his sense of power. Dormer was the senior master at the
      Lower School, but Perrin knew that Dormer did not have these little talks;
      it did not occur to him that the reason might be that Dormer was too
      honorable to care about them. Moreover, as far as Traill was concerned,
      Perrin really felt that it did not do to have masters leaping through
      windows at any hour of the night. The accidental fact that he disliked
      Traill intensely had, he persuaded himself, nothing whatever to do with
      it; he would have felt it just as strongly his duty to speak about it had
      the offender been his dearest friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accumulative irritations of the morning, succeeding a disturbed and
      broken night, only stirred him to further zeal for the school's
      good. The only consoling fact in a dark world was that Miss Desart had, in
      chapel, last evening, looked at him with eyes that seemed to him on fire
      with devotion. He intended, in a day or two, to ask her to come for a walk
      with him... and then another walk... and then another... and then....
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he went to see Moy-Thompson. You can, if the simile is not too
      terribly old, imagine Moy-Thompson as a spider and his study as his web;
      it was certainly dusty enough, with faded busts of Romans and Greeks on
      the top shelves of the book-cases, and gloomy photographs of gloomy places
      on the walls. The two men seemed to suit the place well enough, and its
      depression really brightened Mr. Perrin up. But it must be remarked once
      more that it was not from any anticipation of doing Traill damage that he
      embraced and cuddled his little piece of news so eagerly, but only because
      it helped his sense of importance. He was already wishing that he had told
      Garden Minimus to write his Euclid thirty times instead of fifteen, so
      cheered and inspired did he feel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men understood one another perfectly, and had a mutual respect for
      each other 's strong qualities. No time was wasted in preliminaries,
      and it was a curious coincidence that Moy-Thompson's first question
      should be: &ldquo;What do you think of Traill? How's he doing?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Moy-Thompson is not a pleasant person to contemplate, alone, amongst the
      people of that place, there is nothing whatever to be said for him, and it
      is my intention to pass over him as quickly as may be. Perrin knew from
      the sound of his voice that he had some reason for disliking Traill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think, well enough,&rdquo; he answered, looking out of the
      window. &ldquo;The boys like him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, they like him; do they?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I think he indulges them rather. I'm not quite sure that
      he sticks to his work as he should do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! What does he do?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found him jumping through the Lower School dining-room window at
      one o'clock this morning.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did you!&rdquo; Moy-Thompson smiled. &ldquo;Where had he been?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't ask.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin pulled his gown about him. A sudden distaste for the whole business
      had seized him; after another word or two he went away, back to his own
      rooms.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Traill was tired and cross and out of temper with the world. He
      found that there was more to be said for the stay-at-home tastes of the
      rest of the staff than he had suspected. You couldn't, if you went
      gaily dancing the evening before, embrace early morning preparations with
      the eagerness and even the attention that it properly demanded. His mind
      was heavy, drowsy; he had forgotten his anger with Perrin and was only
      rather amused by the whole affair of the night before; but, instead of
      correcting Latin exercises, he sat, with his eyes gazing dreamily out of
      the window, his thoughts on Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found first hour tiresome and irritating. He lost his temper for the
      first time that term, and went, at the end of the second hour, into the
      Upper School common room with a cloudy brow and dragging feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anything drearier than this place it would be impossible to conceive.
      There was a long, red-clothed table, a black, yawning grate, a dozen stiff
      wooden chairs and, scattered about the room, the whole of the staff
      waiting for the bell to ring for third hour. This was the most irritating
      quarter of an hour of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several men, Comber, Clinton, Dormer, and another, were bending over the
      table, supervising the selection of the team for the afternoon's
      match. As Traill came in he heard Comber's voice: &ldquo;Toggett at
      three-quarter is perfectly absurd. That's obviously Traill's
      choice. Traill may be able to play, but his knowledge of the theory of the
      game is absolutely nil.&rdquo; Comber has resented Traill's entrance
      into the school football from the very first. He, although many years past
      his game, had hitherto led the Rugby enthusiasts of the school&mdash;he
      had been supreme on the Committee and had had the last word about the
      teams. Traill's football, however, was so obviously superior to
      anything that the school had had for a great many years that he was
      received with open arms. He had not perhaps been as judiciously submissive
      to Comber as he might have been, but he had always deferred his opinion
      and had never been goaded by Comber's caustic contradictions into
      ill-temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not now show any ill-temper, but only, with a laugh as he came up
      to the table, said, &ldquo;Thanks, Comber.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Dormer hurried to make peace, but Comber continued to mutter: &ldquo;What
      the devil you want to put the man there for, I can't think....&rdquo;
      By the window Birkland and Monsieur Pons were arguing about the latter's
      discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should get them to stamp and rush about a bit more, Pons, if I
      were you,&rdquo; Birkland was saying. &ldquo;It's so delightful for
      me, being just under you. It is so easy for me to do my work, so nice to
      think that they really <i>are</i> enjoying themselves.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Monsieur Pons was waving his arms, excitedly. &ldquo;I keep them perfectly
      still this morning, as still as one mouse. No one stirs. You can hear a
      pin drop.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have dropped a cartload of them,&rdquo; said Birkland,
      frowning. &ldquo;Try and drop less next time.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly in the middle of the room there appeared the school sergeant.
      That could only mean one thing, and conversation instantly ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Moy-Thompson wishes to see Mr. Traill at twelve,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comber gave a grunt of satisfaction. Traill laughed. &ldquo;I thought
      things were a little too pleasant to last,&rdquo; he said. His mind flew
      back to the incidents of last night. Surely Perrin couldn't have
      said anything. Probably Moy-Thompson had heard of it in some other way. He
      shrugged his shoulders and thought, as he looked round the dreary room,
      that schoolmastering wasn't always pleasant. He wondered, too, a
      little unhappily, why, when one wanted things to go well everything should
      go wrong, through no fault of one's own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here were Perrin and Comber, for instance; they both obviously disliked
      him, and yet he had done nothing to either of them. As he went out, he
      caught White looking at him timidly, but sympathetically, and he smiled at
      him. And indeed at twelve, when he knocked on the door at the end of the
      dark passage, it was chiefly his memory of the last occasion that he had
      been there, of White's pale face, that remained with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pathos has, too, often its intense, pathetic moment coming, for no
      definite reason, out of a mysterious distance and choosing to fill, as
      water fills a pool, rooms and places and companies of people. Now,
      suddenly, this study; with Moy-Thompson in it was a place, to Traill, of
      the intensest pathos, so that it seemed strange that, with such brilliant
      things as the world contained, it should be allowed to continue. His own
      position was lost in the perpetual vision of White standing, as he had
      seen him, with bent head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Traill,&rdquo; said Moy-Thompson. &ldquo;Sit down. I have been
      wanting to have a talk with you. I hope that this time is quite
      convenient?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly,&rdquo; said Traill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been intending to come down and look at your form, but I
      have had no opportunity. I must try and manage next week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill said nothing. Moy-Thompson smiled at him. &ldquo;I hope that you
      have had no trouble with discipline.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None. The boys are excellent.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! that is splendid.&rdquo; There was a pause; then the beard was
      suddenly lifted, and a glance was flashed across the table. &ldquo;I hope
      that you take your work seriously, Mr. Traill.&rdquo; Traill flushed a
      little. &ldquo;I think that I do,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is well.... Because we are&mdash;ah! um&mdash;a great
      institution, a very great institution. We owe our traditions&mdash;um, eh&mdash;a
      very serious and determined attention to detail. To work together, as one
      man, for the good of our race, that must be our object. Yes. No divisions,
      all in friendly brotherhood&mdash;um, yes.&rdquo; Traill said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that you realize this. We want every energy, every nerve, at
      work. We must not waste a moment, nor grudge every instant to the cause we
      have at heart. Um, yes, I hope that you agree, Mr. Traill.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; Traill said, &ldquo;that you have not found me
      wanting, that you have nothing to complain of. I think that I have worked&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Worked? Ah, yes.&rdquo; Moy-Thompson caught him up, cracking his
      fingers together. &ldquo;But what about play, eh? What about play?&rdquo;
      Traill flushed. &ldquo;As to football&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not football. It is merely a detail&mdash;quite a detail.
      But Mr. Perrin informs me that you came in at one o'clock this
      morning through the window. I confess that I was surprised.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; said Traill, in a low voice. &ldquo;I
      went&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! no! please!&rdquo; Mr. Thompson lifted a large white hand.
      &ldquo;No details are necessary. The facts are sufficient. I need not, I
      think, say any more. You must see for yourself.... Only, I think you will
      agree with me that it should not occur again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry&mdash;&rdquo; Traill said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, please! No more; it shall not be mentioned again. Only work and
      play together are impossible. We have long vacations that give us all we
      ask. To pass for a moment to another matter.&rdquo; Moy-Thompson put his
      hand on some papers. &ldquo;Here are the scholarship questions that you
      have set&mdash;geography and history. I think they are scarcely what we
      require. If you would not mind resetting them and bringing them to me
      to-morrow. Yes. Thank you.... Good morning.&rdquo; Traill rose, took the
      papers in his hand, and left the room. He knew, surely, certainly, as
      though Birkland himself had told him, that this was to be the beginning of
      persecution. The Reverend Moy-Thompson had got his knife into him, and he
      had Perrin to thank for it.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The interview that had lasted barely five minutes hung heavily over him
      throughout the midday dinner. He always hated the meal: the great joints
      of mutton, waiting to be carved, in shapeless, thick hunks, the incessant
      noise throughout the meal, the clatter of plates and noise and voices, the
      dreary monotony and repetition of it&mdash;Perrin's face seen at the
      end of a long white table with the two rows of boys in between.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-day as he sat there he felt that he could kill Perrin if he had the
      opportunity. What business was it of his? He had at any rate lost no time
      in running to tell Moy-Thompson about it. The thought of the savage joy
      that must have filled Perrin's breast whilst he told his news, made
      Traill grind his teeth. Well! he would be even with him!
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the meal was over, and grace had been chanted in a loud,
      discordant yell, Traill left the table and, without a word to anyone,
      rushed down to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A tremendous wind was blowing. There was a certain part of the cliff that
      jutted out into the water, and this was surrounded now, on three sides, by
      a furious, heaving flood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wet mist hung over the sea, so that the enormous breakers leapt out of the
      sea, came whistling with a thousand arms into the sky, and them fell with
      a deafening roar upon the rocks. One after another, in swift succession,
      first suspended in mid-air, hanging there like serpents about to strike,
      then falling with a curve and glistering, shining backs, then sweeping,
      tearing, at last lashing the iron rock. About him the wind screamed and
      tugged at his clothes; behind him the trees bent and creaked along the
      road; the rain lashed his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was seized with a kind of fury; he stood, facing the sea, with his
      hands clenched, his head up, his cap in his hand, and Isabel Desart, as
      she came battling down the road and saw him there, knew, in that moment,
      that she loved him and had loved him from the first moment that she saw
      him. He saw her, but they could not speak to one another: the noise was
      too great&mdash;the waves, the wind, the bending trees caught them into
      their clamor; they stood, side by side, in silence. Suddenly he put out
      his hand and caught hers. He held it; still, without a word, with the wind
      almost flinging them to the ground, they drew together. The mist swept
      about their heads, the spray beat in their faces. He drew her closer to
      him, and she yielded. For a moment he held her with his face pressed close
      against hers, and then their lips met. At last, and still without a word,
      they moved slowly down the road....
    </p>
    <h3>
      V.
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was about half-past nine when Perrin, looking up at the sound of the
      opening door, saw Traill standing there. Traill filled the doorway, and
      Perrin knew at once that there was going to be a disturbance. He had had
      disturbances before, a good many of them, and always it had brought to him
      a sense of pathos that he, with an old mother (he always saw her as a
      crumpled but vehement background), should have always to be fighting
      people&mdash;he, so unoffending if they would let him alone. However, if
      anyone (especially Traill) wished to fight him, he would do his best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill was frowning. Traill was very angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin said, &ldquo;Ah, Traill! Come in for a chat? That's good of
      you. Splendid! Sit down, won't you? Anything I can do for you?&rdquo;
      But he wasn't smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Traill, slowly. &ldquo;There's nothing you
      can do for me. But I want to speak to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, sit down; won't you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thanks. I 'll stand.&rdquo; Traill cleared his throat.
      &ldquo;Did you by any chance say anything to the Head about my coming in
      last night?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin smiled. &ldquo;My dear Traill, I really can't remember; and
      is it really, after all, any business of yours?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this much, that he has been speaking to me about it. He says
      that you told him&mdash;I want to know why you told him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my business,&rdquo; Perrin said, &ldquo;as housemaster here
      to find out anything that may be harming my house. I consider your late
      hours, your disregard of your work, prejudicial to the school's
      progress,&mdash;um, yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The impulse that had brought Traill to Perrin's room had not
      altogether been one of anger. He was much too excited by the other event
      of the afternoon to have any very angry feelings against anyone, and
      indeed it had been rather a desire for peace, for clearing things up and
      being well with the world, that had brought him there. He was a little
      ashamed of the way that he had allowed, during these last weeks, his anger
      against Perrin to grow, and he seemed to be losing some of his good-humor
      and equability.
    </p>
    <p>
      So now he put all the self-command that he possessed into play, and said
      quietly, &ldquo;I'm sorry, Perrin, if you feel that I have been
      neglecting my duty. I don't think that, after all, one night's
      outing during the term can do anyone very great harm. But I only spoke to
      you about it because I have been feeling during these last weeks that we
      have not been very good friends. It seems a pity when we are cooped up
      together here so closely that we should not get on as well as possible; it
      makes everything uncomfortable. And, in so far as I am to blame at all, I
      am very sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The little red and yellow china man on the mantelpiece, Perrin said, had
      been watching the conversation with great curiosity, and Perrin felt that
      he was a little disappointed now when matters promised to finish
      comfortably. Perrin himself was only too ready for peace. These quarrels
      always brought on headaches, and, in his heart, he longed eagerly,
      hungrily, for a friend. He already was beginning to feel again that he
      liked young Traill very much.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat back in his chair and meant to be pleasant once more; but it was
      his eternal misfortune, his curse from the deriding gods, that he had ever
      at his hack the memory of all these jesting years that had already passed
      him by: the memory of the men, the boys, the women, who had laughed at
      him: the memory of the ways that he had suffered, of the taunting jeers
      that had been flung at him, of the jests that so many of his fellow-beings
      had, in his time, played upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so now he felt that at all costs he must regain his dignity, he must
      show this young fellow his place and then be nice to him afterwards; and
      really, somewhere in the hack of his mind, he saw his old mother with her
      white lace cap sitting stiffly in her chair, and Traill on his knees,
      kissing her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Traill, I 'm sure I 'm glad you feel like that&mdash;um,
      yes. One must, you know, maintain discipline. You are young; when you are
      older you will see that there is something in what I say&mdash;um. We
      know, you see; schoolmastering is a thing that takes some learning; yes,
      well, I'm sure I'm very glad.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Traill was white again; his good determinations, his pleasant tempers
      were flung, suddenly screaming, helter-skelter to the winds. The patronage
      of it, the stupid, blundering fool with his &ldquo;When you are older,&rdquo;
      and the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said hotly; &ldquo;keep that advice for
      others. I don't know that I was so wrong, after all. What business
      of yours was it to go sneaking to the Head like that? There are certain
      things that a gentleman doesn't do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really!&rdquo;&mdash;the little man on the mantelpiece was
      smiling again. Perrin was snarling, and his hands gripped the sides of his
      chair. &ldquo;Your apologies seem a little premature. One can forgive
      something to your age, but that sort of impertinence&mdash;I don't
      think you remember to whom you are speaking. You are the junior master
      here, you must be taught that, and when those who are wiser than yourself
      choose to give you some advice, you should take it gratefully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill took a step down the room, his hands clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! you conceited, insufferable&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of my room!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, when I 've told you what I 've thought of
      you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of my room!&rdquo; Perrin's eyes were starting out of
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill swung on his heel. &ldquo;I won't forget this in a hurry,&rdquo;
      he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take care you don't come in here again,&rdquo; Perrin shouted
      after him. The door was banged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin sat back in his chair; the room was going round and round, and he
      had a confused idea that people were running races. He pressed his hands
      to his head; the little china man leapt, screaming, off the mantelpiece
      and ran at him, kicking up his fat little legs; and with the breeze from
      under the door, a pile of French exercises fluttered, blew like sails in
      the wind, and then slid, scattering, to the floor.

    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>UT, during the
      week that followed, Traill's good-temper slowly reasserted itself
      once more. After all, it was really impossible to be angry with anyone
      when the world was alight and trembling with so wonderful an adventure.
      They had each of them written to those in authority. Isabel had a
      complacent father who knew something of young Traill's family and,
      answering at once, said that he would come down to see them and made it
      his only stipulation that the engagement should last for at least a year,
      until they were both a little older. Traill's mother was delighted
      with anything that could give her son such happiness. It had all been very
      sudden of course; but then, was not true love always like that? Had not
      she, a great many years ago, fallen in love with Archie's father
      &ldquo;all in a minute,&rdquo; and was not that the beautiful incautious
      way that the new practical generation seemed so often to forget? So, she
      sent him her blessing and also wrote a little note to Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they still kept their secret from the others. They meant every day to
      reveal it, but they shrank, as each morning came, from all the talk and
      chatter that would at once follow. It would mean an end, Isabel knew, to
      any easy and pleasant relations that she might have with anyone at the
      school. She never understood the reason, but she knew that they would feel
      that she had acted in a conceited, presuming manner. It would not be
      pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      So their meetings were, during these days, few and difficult. They met in
      the wood and at the sea, and their eyes crossed over the chapel floor, and
      they even wrote to one another and posted them elaborately in the
      letter-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on any morning the secret might be revealed. Traill told Isabel about
      his quarrel with Perrin, and she urged him to make it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we ourselves are so happy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we can't
      quarrel with anyone&mdash;and, poor man, no wonder his temper is
      irritable. He's a miserably disappointed man, and I don't
      think he's very well either. He looks dreadfully white and strained
      sometimes. We can afford to put up with some ill-temper from other people,
      Archie, just now. When we are so happy and he is so unhappy, it is a
      little unfair, isn't it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he kissed her and went back resolved to be pleasant and agreeable.
      But Perrin gave him no opportunity. They spoke to each other a little at
      meals for appearance' sake, but any advances that Traill made were
      cut short at once without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin passed about the passages and the class-rooms during this week
      heavily, with a white face and a lowering brow&mdash;he had headaches, bad
      headaches; and his form suffered.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      And so it was suddenly, without warning or preparation, that the storm
      broke&mdash;the storm that was to be remembered for years afterwards at
      Moffatt's: the great Battle of the Umbrella, about which strange
      myths grew up, that will become, doubtless, in later centuries at Moffatt's
      a strange Titanic contest, with gods for its warriors and thunderbolts for
      their weapons; the great battle that involved not only the central
      combatants, not only Traill and Perrin and their lives and fortunes, but
      also others&mdash;the Combers, the matrons, the masters, the whole world
      of that place seized by the Furies... and, in the corner, in that
      umbrella-stand by the hall door, underneath the stairs, that faded green
      umbrella&mdash;now, we suppose, passed into that limbo into which all
      umbrellas must eventually go, but then the gage, the glove, the sign token
      of all that was to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let, moreover, no one imagine that these things are not possible. This
      Battle of the Umbrella stands for more, for far more, than its immediate
      contest. Here is the whole protest and appeal of all those crowded,
      stifled souls buried of their own original free-will beneath fantastic
      piles of scribbled paper, cursing their fate, but unable to escape from
      it, seeing their old age as a broken, hurried scrambling to a no-man's
      grave, with no dignity nor suavity, with no temper nor discipline, with
      nerves jangling like the broken wires of a shattered harp&mdash;so that
      there is no comfort or hope in the future, nothing but disappointment and
      insult in the past, and the dry, bitter knowledge of failure in the
      present&mdash;this is the Battle of the Umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Monday morning, and Monday morning is worse than any other day of
      the week.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been, in spite of many services and the reiteration of religious
      stories concerning which a shower of inconvenient questions are flung at
      the uncertain convictions of authority, a relief in the rest and repose of
      the preceding day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday was, at any rate, a day to look forward to in that it was different
      from the other six days of the week, and although it might not on its
      arrival show quite so pleasant a face as earlier hours had given it,
      nevertheless it was something&mdash;a landmark if nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now on this dark and dreary Monday&mdash;with the first hour a tedious
      and bickering discussion on Divinity, and the second hour a universal and
      embittered Latin exercise&mdash;that early rising to the cold summoning of
      the hell was anything but pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, on this especial Monday the rain came thundering in furious
      torrents, and the row of trees opposite the Lower School wailed and cried
      with their dripping, naked boughs, and all the brown leaves on the paths
      were beaten and flattened into a miserable and hopeless pulp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monday was the only morning in the week on which Traill took early
      preparation at the Upper School, and he had noticed before that it nearly
      always rained on Mondays. He was in no very bright temper as he hurried
      down the cold stone passages, pulling on his gown and avoiding the bodies
      of numerous small boys who flung themselves against him as they rushed
      furiously downstairs in order to be in time for call-over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the rain beating against the window-panes and hurriedly selected
      the first umbrella that he saw in the stand and rushed to the Upper
      School.
    </p>
    <p>
      That preparation hour was unpleasant. M. Pons, the French master, was in
      the room above him, and the ceiling shook with the delighted stamp of
      twenty boys blessed with a sense of humor and an opportunity of power. M.
      Pons could be figured with shaking hands in the middle of the room,
      appealing for quiet. And, as was ever the case, the spirit of rebellion
      passed down through the ceiling to the room beneath. Traill had his boys
      well under control; but whereas on ordinary occasions it was all done
      without effort and worked of its own accord, on this morning continual
      persistence was necessary, and he had to make examples of various
      offenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A preparation hour always invited the Seven Devils to dance across the two
      hundred of open books, and the tweaking of boys' bodies and the
      digging of pins into unsuspecting legs was the inevitable result. Traill
      rose at the end of the hour, cross, irritable, and already tired. He
      hurried down to the Lower School to breakfast and forgot the umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain was driving furiously against the window-panes of the Junior
      common room. The windows were tightly closed, and still the presence of
      yesterday's mutton was felt heavily, gloomily, about the ceiling.
      The brown and black oilcloth contained numberless little winds and
      draughts that leapt out from under it and crept here and there about the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small fire was burning in the grate&mdash;a mountain of black coal and
      stray spirals of gray smoke, and little white edges of unburnt paper
      hanging from the black bars. Beyond the side door voices quarreling in the
      kitchen could be heard, and beyond the other door a hum of voices and a
      clatter of cups.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was all so dingy that it struck even the heavy brain of Clinton, who
      was down first. Perrin was taking breakfast in the big dining-room, and
      Traill was not yet hack from the Upper School.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clinton seized the <i>Morning Post</i> and, with a grunt of
      dissatisfaction at the general appearance of things, sat down. He never
      thought very intently about anything, but, in a vague way, he did dislike
      Monday and rain and a smoking fire. He helped himself to more than his
      share of the breakfast, ate it in large, noisy mouthfuls, found the <i>Morning
      Post</i> dull, and relapsed on to the <i>Daily Mail</i>. The rain and the
      quarreling in the kitchen were very disturbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Traill came in and sat down with an air of relief. He had no very
      great opinion of Clinton, but they got on together quite agreeably, and he
      found that it was rather pleasanter to have an entirely negative person
      with one&mdash;it was not necessary to think about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word,&rdquo; said Clinton, his eyes glued to the <i>Daily Mail</i>,
      &ldquo;the London Scottish fairly wiped the floor with the Harlequins
      yesterday&mdash;two goals and a try to a try&mdash;all that man Binton&mdash;extraordinary
      three-quarter&mdash;no flies on him! Have some sausages? Not bad. I wonder
      if they 'll catch that chap Deakin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Deakin?&rdquo; said Traill rather drearily, looking up from his
      breakfast. How dismal it all was this morning! Oh, well&mdash;in a year's
      time!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you know&mdash;the Hollins Road murder&mdash;the man who cut
      his wife and mother into little bits and mixed them up so that they couldn't
      tell which was which. There's a photograph of him here and his front
      door.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Traill, shortly, &ldquo;following up murder
      trials like that is perfectly beastly. It isn't civilized.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right!&rdquo; said Clinton, helping himself to the remaining
      sausages. &ldquo;Perrin's having breakfast in there, isn't he?
      He won't want any more.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He sometimes does,&rdquo; said Traill, feeling that at the moment
      he hated Clinton's good-natured face more than anything in the whole
      world. &ldquo;He's awfully sick if he comes in hungry and doesn't
      find anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clinton smiled. &ldquo;He's rather amusing when he's sick,&rdquo;
      he said. &ldquo;He so often is. By the way, has the Head passed those
      exam, questions of yours yet?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Traill, frowning. &ldquo;He 's made me do
      them five times now, and last time he crossed but a whole lot of questions
      that he himself had suggested the time before. I pointed that out to him,
      and he called me, politely and gently, but firmly, a liar. There's
      no question that he's got his knife into me now, and I've got
      friend Perrin to thank for it!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clinton, helping himself to marmalade, &ldquo;Perrin
      does n't love you&mdash;there's no question of that. Young
      Garden Minimus has been helping the feud.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Garden? What's he got to do with it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know that he was always Old Pompous' especial pet&mdash;well,
      Pompous has riled him, kept him in or something, so now he goes about
      telling everybody that he's transferred his allegiance to you. That
      makes Pompous sick as anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like the kid especially,&rdquo; Traill said. &ldquo;He 's
      rather a favorite of mine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Clinton. &ldquo;Well, look out for trouble, that
      's all. There 'll be open war between you soon if you are not
      careful.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment Perrin came in. He was continuing, as he entered, a
      conversation with some small boy whose head just appeared at the door for
      a moment and revealed Garden Minimus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, a hundred times,&rdquo; Perrin was saying, &ldquo;and you don't
      go out till you 've done it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Garden displayed annoyance, and was heard to mutter under his breath.
      Perrin's face was gray; his hair appeared to be unbrushed, and there
      was a good deal of white chalk on the back of his sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, it's too bad,&rdquo; he said to no one in particular
      and certainly not to Traill. &ldquo;I don't know what's come
      over that boy&mdash;nothing but continuous impertinence. He shall go up to
      the Head if he isn't careful. Such a nice boy, too, before this
      term.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment he saw that Traill was reading the <i>Morning Post</i> and
      Clinton the <i>Daily Mail</i>. He looked as though he were going to say
      something, then by a tremendous effort controlled himself. He stood in
      front of the dismal fire and looked at the other two, at the dreary
      window-panes and the driving rain, at the dusty pigeon-holes, the untidy
      heap of books, the torn lists hanging from the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had slept badly&mdash;had lain awake for hours thinking of Miss Desart,
      of his own miserable condition, of his poor mother&mdash;and then,
      slumbering at last, in an instant he had been pulled, dragged wide-awake
      by that thundering, clamoring bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been so tired that his eyes had refused to open, and he had sat
      stupidly on the edge of his bed with his head swaying and nodding. Then he
      had been late for preparation, and he knew that they had been &ldquo;playing
      about&rdquo; and had rubbed Somerset-Walpole's head in the ink and
      had stamped on his body, because, although it was so early,
      Somerset-Walpole's eyes were already red, his back a horrible
      confusion of dust and chalk, his hair and collar ink and disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sorry for Somerset-Walpole, whose days were a perpetual tragedy;
      but as there was no other obvious victim, he selected him for the subject
      of his wrath, expatiated to the form on the necessity of getting up clean
      in the morning, and sent the large, blubbering creature up to the matron
      to be cleansed and scolded. Verily the delights of some people's
      school days have been vastly exaggerated!
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Garden Minimus had been discovered sticking nibs into the fleshy
      portion of his neighbor, and, although he had vehemently denied the crime,
      had been heavily punished and had therefore sulked during the rest of the
      hour. At breakfast-time Perrin had called him up to him and had hinted
      that if he chose to be agreeable once again the punishment might be
      relaxed; but Garden did not please, and sulked and muttered under his
      breath, and Perrin thought he had caught the word &ldquo;Pompous.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      All these things may have been slight in themselves, but combined they
      amounted to a great deal&mdash;and all before half-past eight in the
      morning. Also he had had very little to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been brought a small red tomato and a hard, rocky wedge of bacon
      with little white eyes in it, and an iron determination to hold out at all
      costs, whatever the consumer's appetite and determination. He smelt,
      when he came into the common room, sausages, and he saw, with a glance of
      the eye, that there were sausages no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really think, Clinton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that a little less
      appetite on your part in the early morning would be better for everyone
      concerned.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Clinton was always perfectly good-tempered, and all he said now was,
      &ldquo;All right, old chap&mdash;I always have an awful appetite in the
      morning. I always had.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin drew himself to his full height and prepared to be dignified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clinton said, &ldquo;I say, old man, you 've got chalk all over your
      sleeve.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Perrin, finding that it was indeed true, could say nothing and feebly
      tried to brush it off with his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill had not spoken since Perrin had come in. He disliked intensely the
      atmosphere of restraint in the room. He had never before been on such bad
      terms with anyone, and now at every turn there were discomforts,
      difficulties, stiffnesses. At this moment he loathed the term and the
      place and the people as he had never loathed any of them before; he felt
      that he could not possibly last until the holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin was going to the Upper School for first hour. He was going to teach
      Divinity, the lesson that he loathed most of all. He gathered his. books
      up and his gown, and went out into the hall to find his umbrella. The rain
      was falling more heavily than before, and lashed the panes as though it
      had some personal grievance against them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert, the general factotum&mdash;a long, pale man with a spotty face and
      a wonderful capacity for dropping china&mdash;came in to collect the
      breakfast things. He passed, clattering about the table. Traill was still
      deep in the <i>Morning Post.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin came in with a clouded brow. &ldquo;I can't find,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;my umbrella.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The rain beat upon the frames, Robert clashed the plates together, but
      there was no answer. Clinton's head was in his pigeonhole, looking
      for papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robert, have you seen my umbrella?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      No, Robert had not seen any umbrella. He might have seen an umbrella last
      week, somewhere upstairs, in Miss Madder's room&mdash;an umbrella
      with lace, pink&mdash;Oh! of course, a parasol. There were three umbrellas
      in the stand by the hall door. Perhaps one of those was the one. No? Mr.
      Perrin had looked? Well, he didn't know of anywhere else. No&mdash;perhaps
      one of the young gentlemen.... There was nothing at all to be got out of
      Robert.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clinton!&rdquo; No answer. &ldquo;Clinton!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Clinton turned round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Clinton, have you seen my umbrella?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, old man&mdash;why should I? Isn't it outside?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting late, the rain was pelting down, and Perrin was quite
      determined that he would <i>not</i> under any circumstances use anyone
      else's umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out again and looked in the hall. He was beginning to get very
      angry. Was not this the last straw sent by the little gods to break his
      humble back? That it should be raining, that he should be late, and that
      there should be no umbrella! He stormed about the hall, he looked in
      impossible places, he shook the three umbrellas that were there; he began
      to mutter to himself&mdash;the little red and yellow china man was
      creeping down the stairs. He was shaking all over, and his hands were
      trembling like leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came into the common room again. &ldquo;I can't think&mdash;&rdquo;
      he said, with his trembling hand to his forehead. &ldquo;I know I had it
      yesterday&mdash;last night. Clinton, you <i>must</i> have seen it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Clinton in that abstract voice that is so
      profoundly irritating because it shows that the speaker's thoughts
      are far away. &ldquo;No&mdash;I don't think I've seen it. What
      did I do with that Algebra? Oh! there it is. My word! is n't it
      raining!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Upper School bell began, far in the distance, its raucous clanging.
      Perrin was pacing up and down the room; every now and again he flung a
      furtive glance at Traill. Traill had paid, hitherto, no attention to the
      conversation. At last, hearing the Upper School bell, he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Robert,&rdquo; said Perrin, turning round to the factotum,
      &ldquo;you <i>must</i> have seen it somewhere. It's absurd! I want
      to go out.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the other gentlemen's,&rdquo; said Robert, looking
      a little frightened of Perrin's twitching lips and white face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It dawned upon Traill slowly that Perrin was looking for an umbrella. Then
      on that it followed that possibly the umbrella that he had taken that
      morning might be Perrin's umbrella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it <i>must</i> be Perrin's umbrella. It was just the sort
      of umbrella, with its faded silk and stupid handle, that Perrin would be
      likely to have. However, it was really very awkward&mdash;most awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up and stayed with a hand nervously fingering the <i>Morning Post</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin rushed once more into the hall and then came furiously back.
      &ldquo;I <i>must</i> have my umbrella,&rdquo; he said, storming at Robert.
      &ldquo;I want to go to the Upper School.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had left the door a little open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; Traill began; the paper crackling beneath
      his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin wheeled round and stared at him, his face very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very sorry,&rdquo; said Traill again, &ldquo;but I'm
      afraid I must have taken it&mdash;my mistake. I wouldn't have taken
      it if I had dreamed&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You!&rdquo; said Perrin in a hoarse whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Traill, &ldquo;I'm afraid I took the first
      one I saw this morning. I'm afraid it must have been yours, as yours
      is missing. I assure you&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was smiling a little&mdash;really it was all too absurd. His smile
      drove Perrin into a trembling passion. He took a step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dared to take my umbrella?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without
      asking? I never heard such a piece of impertinence. But it's all of
      a piece&mdash;all of a piece!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's really too absurd,&rdquo; Traill broke in. &ldquo;As
      though a man mightn't take another man's umbrella without all
      this disturbance. It's too absurd.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! is it?&rdquo; said Perrin, his voice shaking. &ldquo;That's
      all of a piece&mdash;that's exactly like the rest of your behavior
      here. You come here thinking that everything and everyone belongs to you.
      Oh, yes! we've all got to bow down to everything that your Highness
      chooses to say. We must give up everything to your Highness&mdash;our
      clothes, our possessions&mdash;you conceited&mdash;insufferable puppy!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      These words were gasped out. Perrin was now entirely beside himself with
      rage. He saw this man here before him as the originator of all his
      misfortunes, all his evils. He had put the other masters against him, he
      had put the boys against him, he had taken Garden away from him, he had
      been against him at every turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      All control, all discipline, everything had fled from Mr. Perrin. He did
      not remember where he was, he did not remember that Robert was in the
      room, he did not remember that the door was open and that the boys could
      hear his shrill, excited voice. He only knew that here, in this smiling,
      supercilious, conceited young man, was his enemy, the man who would rob
      and ruin him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, this is too absurd,&rdquo; said Traill, stepping back a
      little, and conscious of the startled surprise on the face of Robert&mdash;he
      did not want to have a scene before a servant. &ldquo;I am exceedingly
      sorry that I took your umbrella. I don't see that that gives you any
      reason to speak to me like that. We can discuss the matter afterwards&mdash;not
      here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes!&rdquo; screamed Perrin, moving still nearer his enemy.
      &ldquo;Oh! of course to you it is nothing&mdash;nothing at all&mdash;it is
      all of a piece with the rest of your behavior. It you don't know how
      to behave like a gentleman, it's time someone taught you. Gentlemen
      don't steal other people's things. You can be put in prison
      for that sort of thing, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't steal your beastly umbrella,&rdquo; said Traill,
      beginning in his anger to forget the ludicrousness of the situation.
      &ldquo;I don't want your beastly things&mdash;keep them to yourself.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say&rdquo;&mdash;this from Clinton&mdash;&ldquo;chuck it, you
      two. Don't make such a row here&mdash;everyone can hear. Wait until
      later.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Perrin heard nothing. He had stepped up to Traill now and was shaking
      his fist in Traill's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's beastly, is it?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I 'll
      give you something for saying that&mdash;I 'll let you know.&rdquo;
      And then, in a perfect scream, &ldquo;Give me my umbrella! Give me my
      umbrella!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't got your rotten umbrella,&rdquo; shouted Traill.
      &ldquo;I left it somewhere. I've lost it. I'm jolly glad. You
      can jolly well go and look for it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And at this moment, as Clinton afterwards described it, &ldquo;the scrap
      began.&rdquo; Perrin suddenly flung himself upon Traill and beat his face
      with his fist. Traill clutched Perrin's arm and flung him back upon
      the breakfast-table. Perrin's head struck the coffee-pot, and as he
      rose he brought with him the tablecloth and all the things that Robert had
      left upon the table. With a fearful crash of crockery, with the odors of
      streaming coffee, with the cry of the terrified Robert, down everything
      came. Afterwards there was a pause whilst Perrin and Traill swayed
      together, then with another crash, they too came to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clinton and Robert rushed forward. Two Upper School masters, Birkland and
      Comber, surveyed the scene from the doorway. There was an instant's
      absolute silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly Traill and Perrin both rose from the floor. Traill's
      lip was cut and bleeding&mdash;coffee was on Perrin's collar; their
      faces were very white.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment they looked at each other in absolute silence, then they
      passed, without a spoken word, through the open door.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a way, and from such a cause, did this Battle of the Umbrella have
      its beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us credit the gods with interest sufficient, and we see that it had
      been their pleasant amusement to beguile those tedious Olympian hours with
      a game; and to the onlooker, here is comedy enough, for about what simpler
      can mortals dispute than this green umbrella? But for others, more nearly
      concerned, there is some question of tragedy involved.

      SOME SKIRMISHING

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>SABEL DESART heard
      about it early on the afternoon of the same day. Traill himself told her
      as he stood with her for a moment outside the school gates before he went
      down to football.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw it at once more seriously than he did; his attitude had been that
      it was a pity, above all that it was indecorous, that he had, in a way,
      made a fool of himself&mdash;that to struggle in that fashion with a man
      like Perrin before an audience was a pity. But to her it was a great deal
      more than this. In many ways she was older than Archie Traill, and her
      feminine intuition helped her now; she saw Perrin as something to be
      feared and also something to be pitied, and she did not know which of
      these feelings was the stronger. She had always seen Perrin as someone to
      be pitied&mdash;that was the reason of her kindness to him&mdash;and now
      that he was ludicrous, now that his climax had made him prominent, her
      pity for him was increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was also afraid. She guessed suddenly a great deal more than she
      could actually see; she felt the miserable years that he had been through,
      she felt his hatred of his own position, and she knew that he would not be
      likely to forgive the man who had brought all this to a climax.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all at such terribly close quarters. It would be easy enough to
      get away from that sort of incident if they all of them were, as she put
      it to herself, &ldquo;spread out&rdquo;; but halfterm was only just over
      and she did not know what the next six weeks might bring. Traill's
      feeling, she saw, was mainly one of disgust&mdash;the same kind of
      sensation that he would have had if he had not been able to have his bath
      in the morning. About Perrin he only felt contempt, a man who could make
      that kind of disturbance about so small a thing....
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill's final opinion, in fact, about it all was that &ldquo;it
      wasn't done&rdquo; and that Perrin was therefore an &ldquo;outsider,&rdquo;
      and that there the thing ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel, in the few words that he had time to say to her, saw all this and
      knew that his attitude would not make the whole affair any easier. But she
      was wise enough to leave it all where it was for the moment and simply to
      tell him that she was sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing, you know,&rdquo; she said, smiling at him and blushing a
      little. &ldquo;We must let them all know about us, at once, to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! must we?&rdquo; he said, shrinking back a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course. You don't suppose there isn't going to
      be talk about all this business. Of course, there is, heaps&mdash;and you
      must let me do my share of standing up for you. I must have the right, you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not figured the talk that there would be&mdash;he saw it all now in
      an instant, that there would be sides and discussions, and, looking
      further still, he had some idea of all the issues that were to be
      involved; but he was much too simple a person to think this further vision
      anything but fantastic: people simply didn't fight to that extent
      about umbrellas....
    </p>
    <p>
      He left her with a smiling consent to the announcement of their
      engagement, and, for the moment, the thought of that swallowed all the
      Perrin affair. He went down to his football cheerfully.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in the Senior common room, during that interval between chapel
      and dinner, things had occurred. The news of the morning struggle had been
      brought, of course, by the eager witnesses, Comber and Birkland, much
      earlier in the day; but the school day was a very busy one&mdash;one hour
      followed another with terrible swiftness, and then there were boys to see
      and games to play and all the accumulated details to fill in any odd
      moments that there might be,&mdash;so that, with the exception of short
      sentences and exclamations and a general air of pleasurable surprise
      pervading everything, no real movement was possible until this evening
      hour. The room, lighted by gas, was more ugly and naked than ever&mdash;although
      it was close and stuffy, the spirit of it was cold and chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comber was in the chair of honor, the only arm-chair in the room; Birkland
      and Pons, White and Dormer, and the little science master, West, were also
      there. Little West was so obvious and striking an example of his type that
      it seemed as though he had been especially created to stand to the end of
      time as an example of what a Board School education and a pushing
      disposition can do for a man. He was short and square, with a shaggy,
      unkempt mustache and that sallow, unhealthy complexion that two
      generations of ill-fed progenitors tend to produce. He was a little bald
      on the top of his head, wore ready-made clothes, and spoke slowly and with
      great care. He had worked exceedingly hard all his youth and was the only
      master at Moffatt's whose ambitions were unimpaired and his optimism
      (concerning his own future) unchecked. His most striking feature were his
      hard, burning, little eyes, and it was with these that he kept order in
      class.
    </p>
    <p>
      He disliked all the other members of the staff, but he hated Birkland.
      Birkland had, from the first, laughed at him; he had laughed at his
      clothes, at his accent, at his pretensions to being a gentleman (to do
      Birkland justice, if West had never pretended to be a gentleman at all, he
      would have admired and liked him). In fact he made him his chief and
      principal butt; and West, being slow of speech and (outside his own
      subject) slow of brain, could never reply anything at all to Birkland's
      sallies, and was left helpless and fuming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comber was reciting for the hundredth time what it was that he had seen.
      The whole affair gave him very particular pleasure; he thought Traill a
      conceited, insufferable young man, who had come in and taken the football
      out of his hands and supplanted him completely&mdash;whenever he thought
      of it he boiled over with rage; but he had never been able to do anything,
      because Traill had never given himself away. He played football a great
      deal better than Comber even in his palmiest days had ever played it.
      Traill had given him no opportunity until now; but now at last Comber
      glowed with the thought of the things that he would be able to do. He
      intended it in no way maliciously&mdash;it was simply that the younger
      generation should be taught its place; let Traill once submit to Comber's
      rule in the football world and Comber would be pleasant enough. Then
      Comber did not like Birkland's sharp tongue any more than the rest
      of the staff did, and Birkland was a friend of Traill's. Of course,
      on the other side, Comber did not like Perrin either. Perrin was a
      pompous, pretentious fool, but in this case it was clearly Comber's
      duty to uphold the senior staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was leaning back in his arm-chair, with his chest out and one finger
      impressively in the air. &ldquo;There they were, you know, rolling&mdash;positively
      rolling&mdash;on the floor. And all the breakfast things broken to bits
      and the coffee streaming all over the floor&mdash;you never saw anything
      like it. And then up they both got and looked at each other, and went out
      of the room without a word, brushing past Birkland and me as though we
      weren't there; didn't they, Birkland?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Birkland was sitting in his chair with a sad, rather cynical, smile on his
      face, as though he were saying, &ldquo;This is their kind of life. Look at
      Comber there, now&mdash;how pleased he is with things! Will be happy for a
      month at least, and all their little private hates and jealousies are
      being fed just as you feed the snakes at the Zoo. And am I not just as bad
      as the rest? Am I not pleased, because it will give me a chance of having
      a hit at the rest of them?... What a set we are!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he didn't say anything&mdash;he just sat there listening, with
      his contemptuous smile, to Comber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An awful noise, you know, they made,&rdquo; Comber went on. &ldquo;And
      anything funnier than Perrin when he got up you never saw, with his hair
      all tousled and pulled about, and dust all over his back, and his cheek
      bleeding where the coffee-pot had hit him. My word, it was funny!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At all events,&rdquo; said Birkland dryly, &ldquo;we ought all to
      be glad that you got such amusement out of it, Comber. That's
      something to be thankful for, at any rate.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's all very well, Birkland,&rdquo; Comber answered
      angrily; &ldquo;you were amused enough yourself, really&mdash;you know you
      were. In any case,&rdquo; he went on importantly, &ldquo;the thing can't
      go on, you know. We can't have junior masters flinging themselves at
      the throats of senior ones. That sort of thing must be stopped.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was at once apparent on whose side Comber was, and everyone trimmed
      their sails accordingly. If one disliked Comber sufficiently and was not
      afraid of him, one would, of course, for the moment, side with Traill; and
      supposing one wished to get into Comber's good graces (no easy thing
      to do), here would be an excellent opportunity. M. Pons, for instance,
      thought so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;<i>dégoûtant</i>,&rdquo; he cried, waving his hands in
      the air, &ldquo;that a young man, that is here one month, two months,
      should catch the throat of his senior. These things,&rdquo; he added with
      the air of one who waves gloriously the flag of the Republic, &ldquo;are
      not done in my country.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when they are, perhaps you 'll be able to judge of them
      better, Pons,&rdquo; said Birkland. &ldquo;Until then, I should recommend
      silence.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Pons flushed angrily, but made no reply, and then looked appealingly at
      Comber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Birkland,&rdquo; said Comber, &ldquo;if you are going to
      encourage that sort of spirit in the staff, one has nothing to say. I
      daresay you would like all the boys to be springing at one another's
      throats in the same way; if that's what you want, well&mdash;&ldquo;;
      and he waved his hands expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's absurd,&rdquo; said Birkland quietly, &ldquo;of Perrin
      to have made such a fuss. As if a man mayn't borrow another man's
      umbrella without being struck in the face. It's more than absurd, it's
      childish. It's just the sort of thing that Perrin <i>would</i> do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Comber; &ldquo;let Perrin treat you in the
      way that Traill's treated him, and you see what you'd say and
      do. All I know is that you would n't stand it for a minute, you of
      all men, Birkland.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo; Birkland said hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, we all know you haven't got the sweetest of
      tempers, old man,&rdquo; Comber said laughing. &ldquo;You can't lay
      claim to good temper whatever else you may have.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      West laughed also and seemed to enjoy the joke immensely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you 're on the side of authority, West,&rdquo;
      Birkland said. &ldquo;You naturally would be.&rdquo; West was all the more
      annoyed because he didn't in the least understand what Birkland
      meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The atmosphere began to get warm. But Comber despised West as an ally and
      did not think very much of M. Pons, so he turned round to White. White was
      sitting, as he always did, quietly in the background, without saying
      anything. He was so quiet that people often forgot that he was there at
      all. The effect of many years' bullying by Moy-Thompson was to make
      him agree eagerly with the opinion of the last speaker, and therefore
      Comber hadn't any doubt about the support that he would receive. But
      White had never forgotten that handclasp that Traill had given him, and
      now, to everyone's intense surprise, he said, &ldquo;I think
      Birkland's perfectly right. A man oughtn't to lose his temper
      because another man's borrowed his umbrella. I think Traill's
      been very hardly used&mdash;at any rate, we all know what Perrin must be
      to live with.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone was surprised, and Comber so astonished that for some time he
      could find no words at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he broke out, &ldquo;Well, all I can say is that you people don't
      know what you 're in for; if you go on encouraging people like
      Traill to go about stealing people's things&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Comber,&rdquo; Birkland broke in. &ldquo;You've no
      right to say stealing. You may as well try and be fair. Traill never stole
      anything; you'd better be more careful of your words.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I call it stealing anyhow,&rdquo; said Comber hotly. &ldquo;You
      can call it what you like, Birkland. I daresay you've got pet words
      of your own for these things. But when a man takes something that is n't
      his and keeps it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't keep it,&rdquo; Birkland said angrily. &ldquo;You
      're grossly prejudiced, just as you always are.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about yourself?&rdquo; West broke in. &ldquo;People in glass
      houses&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point the temperature of the room became very warm indeed. Comber
      was pale with rage; he had never been so insulted before&mdash;not that it
      very much mattered what a wretched creature like Birkland said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to explain in a loud voice that some people weren't fit to
      be in gentlemen's society, and that though, of course, he wouldn't
      like to mention names, nevertheless, if certain persons thought about it
      long enough, they would probably find that the cap fitted, and that if
      only people could occasionally see themselves as others saw them&mdash;well,
      it might be better for everyone concerned, and then perhaps there would be
      a chance of their behaving decently in decent society, although of course,
      if one's education had been neglected....
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, M. Pons was explaining to West that whether you went in for
      science or modern languages one's opinion of this sort of affair
      must be the same, there was no question about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birkland was sitting back, white and stiff in his chair and wishing that
      he might take all their heads and crash them together in one big <i>debacle</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly, when another two minutes might have been dangerous for
      everyone concerned, the door was flung open, and Clinton entered. He was
      excited, he was stirred; it was obvious that he had news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; he cried, and then stopped. All eyes were upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; he cried again, &ldquo;Traill has just
      told me. He 's engaged to Miss Desart.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At that there was dead silence&mdash;for an instant nobody spoke. Then
      Comber got up from his chair. &ldquo;Well, I'm damned!&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a new development; it is hard to say whether he saw at once then
      the domestic complications into which it would lead him. Miss Desart had
      stayed with them again and again; she was their intimate friend. His wife
      was devoted to her and would, of course, at once espouse her cause. But
      this piece of news made him, Comber, even angrier than he had been before.
      His feeling about the engagement defied analysis, but it rested in some
      curious, hidden way on some strange streak of vanity in him. He had always
      cared very especially for Miss Desart; he had given her, in his clumsy,
      heavy way, little attentions and regards that he gave to very few people.
      He had always thought that she had very great admiration and reverence for
      himself, and now she had engaged herself without a word to him about it to
      someone whom he disliked and disapproved of. He was hurt and displeased,
      he knew that his wife would be delighted&mdash;more trouble at home. Here
      was White openly insulting him in the common room; he was called names by
      Birkland; a nice, pleasant girl had defied him (it had already come to
      that); his wife would probably defy him also in an hour or two&mdash;with
      a muttered word or two, he left the gathering.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the others, this engagement was a piquant development that lent a new
      color to everything. They had all noticed that Mr. Perrin cared for Miss
      Desart, and now this sudden dramatic announcement was another knock in the
      face for that poor, battered gentleman. Of course, she would never have
      accepted him; but, nevertheless, it was rather hard that she should be
      handed over to his hated rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Perrin know?&rdquo; was West's eager question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Clinton smiling, &ldquo;I'm just going to
      tell him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, there is our Mr. Perrin sitting very drearily and alone in
      front of his somber fire. As he sat there it was n't that he was so
      much depressed by the morning's affair as that he was so frightened
      by it&mdash;not frightened because of anything that Traill could do, or
      indeed of anything that anyone could very especially say: he was long past
      the terror of tongues&mdash;but rather afraid of himself and the way that
      he might be going to behave.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had long ago, when he was a very young man indeed, recognized that
      there were two Mr. Perrins; indeed, in all probability, more than two. He
      knew that when he had been quite a boy he had had ideas of being a hero&mdash;a
      hero, of course, just as other young things meant to be heroes, with a
      great deal of recognition and trumpets and bands and one's face in
      the papers. He had, moreover, in those days, a stern and ready belief in
      his own powers and judged, from a comparison of himself with other boys,
      that he was really promising and had a future. He had heard some preacher
      in a sermon&mdash;he went to sermons very often in those days&mdash;say
      that every man had, once at any rate during his lifetime, his chance, and
      that it was his own fault if he missed it; that very often people did not
      know that it had ever come, because they had not been looking out for it,
      and then they cursed Fate when it was really their own fault&mdash;all
      this Perrin remembered, and he would lie awake at nights on the watch for
      this chance&mdash;this splendid moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was one Mr. Perrin; rather a fine one, with a great desire to do the
      right thing, with a very great love for his mother, and with rather a
      pathetic anxiety to have friends and affection and to do good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was the other Mr. Perrin&mdash;the ill-tempered, pompous,
      sarcastic, bitter Mr. Perrin. When Perrin No. 1 was uppermost, he
      recognized and deeply regretted Perrin No. 2; but when Perrin No. 2 was in
      command, he saw nothing but a spiteful and malignant world trying, as he
      phrased it, to &ldquo;do him down.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, as he sat sadly by his fire, he saw them both. That Mr. Perrin this
      morning had, of course, been Perrin No. 2, and Perrin No. 2 very fierce
      and strong and warlike. Perrin No. 1 was afraid. If this sort of thing
      continued, then Perrin No. 1 would disappear altogether. This term had
      been worse than ever, and he had begun it with so strong a determination
      to make a good thing of it! This young Traill&mdash;and then Perrin No. 2
      showed his head again, and the room grew dark and there was thunder in the
      air. But, oh! if he could only have his chance! If he could only prove the
      kind of man that he <i>could</i> be! If he could only get out of this,
      away from it&mdash;if someone would take him away from it: he did not feel
      strong enough, after all these years, to go away by himself. And then,
      suddenly, he thought of Miss Desart. He saw her as his shining light, his
      beacon. There was his salvation; he would make her love him and care for
      him. He would show her the kind of man that he could be; and then at the
      thought of it he began to smile, and a little color crept into his pale
      cheeks, and he felt that if only that were possible, he might be quite
      pleasant to Traill and the rest. Oh! they would matter so little!
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded humorously to the little man on the mantelpiece and fell into a
      delicious reverie. He forgot the quarrel of the morning, the insults that
      he had received, all the talk that there would be, all the opportunities
      that it would give to his enemies to say what they thought about him. And
      then, perhaps, with her by his side, he might rise to great things: he
      would have a little house, there would be children, he would be his own
      master, life would be free, splendid, above all, tranquil. He could make
      her so fond of him&mdash;he was sure that he could; there were sides of
      him that no one had ever seen&mdash;even his mother did not know all that
      was in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin No. 1 filled the dingy room with his radiance. There was a knock on
      the door. Clinton came in, a pipe in his mouth, a book in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! here's your Algebra that you lent me. I meant to have
      returned it before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thanks!&rdquo; Perrin was always rather short with Clinton.
      &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No thanks, I'm taking prep.&rdquo; Nevertheless, Clinton
      lingered a little, talking about nothing in particular; he stood by the
      mantelpiece, fingering things&mdash;a practice that always annoyed Perrin
      intensely,&mdash;then he took up the little china man and looked at him.
      &ldquo;Rum chap that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, chin-chin&mdash;&rdquo;
      He moved off; he stood for a moment by the door. &ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo;
      he said, half turning round, his hand on the handle; &ldquo;have you heard
      the news? Traill's engaged to Miss Desart. He's just told me.&rdquo;
      He looked at Perrin for a moment, and then went out, banging the door
      behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin did not move; his hands began to shake; then suddenly his head fell
      between his shoulders, and his body heaved with sobs. He sat there for a
      long time, then he began to pace his room; his steps were faster and
      faster&mdash;he was like a wild animal in a cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he stopped in front of the little china man. His face was white,
      his eyes were large and staring; with a wild gesture he picked the thing
      up and flung it to the ground, where it lay at his feet, smashed into
      atoms....

      CHAPTER IX&mdash;THE BATTLE OP THE UMBRELLA; WITH THE LADIES
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>SABEL told Mrs.
      Comber on that same afternoon at tea-time; but that good lady, owing to
      the interruption of the other good ladies and her own Mr. Comber, was
      unable to say anything really about it until just before going to bed.
      Mrs. Comber would not have been able to say very much about it in any case
      quite at first, because her breath was so entirely taken away by surprise,
      and then afterwards by delight and excitement. For herself this term had,
      so far, been rather a difficult affair: money had been hard, and Freddie
      had been even harder&mdash;and hard, as she complained, in such strange,
      tricky comers&mdash;never when you would expect him to be and always when
      you wouldn't. This Mrs. Comber considered terribly unfair, because
      if one knew what he was going to mind, one would look out for it and be
      especially careful; but when he let irritating things pass without a word
      and then &ldquo;flew out&rdquo; when there was nothing for anyone to be
      distressed about, life became a hideous series of nightmares with the
      enemy behind every hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber knew that this term had been worse than usual, because she had
      arrived already, although it was only just past halfterm, at the condition
      of saying nothing to Freddie when he spoke to her&mdash;she called it
      submission, but she never arrived at it until she was nearly at the limits
      of her endurance. And now this news of Isabel suddenly made the world
      bright again; she loved Isabel better than anyone in the world except
      Freddie and the children; and her love was of the purely unselfish kind,
      so that joy at Isabel's happiness far outweighed her own
      discomforts. She was really most tremendously glad, glad with all her size
      and volubility and color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel talked to her in her bedroom&mdash;it was of course also Freddie's,
      but he had left no impression on it whatever, whereas <i>she</i>, by a
      series of touches&mdash;the light green wall-paper and the hard black of
      the shining looking-glass, the silver things, and the china things (not
      very many, but all made the most of),&mdash;had made it her own
      unmistakably, so that everything shouted Mrs. Comber with a war of
      welcome. It was indeed, in spite of the light green paper, a noisy
      impression, and one had always the feeling that things&mdash;the china,
      the silver, and the chairs&mdash;jumped when one wasn't in, charged,
      as it were, with the electricity of Mrs. Comber's temperament and
      the color of her dresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of course Isabel knew it all well enough, and she didn't in the
      least mind the stridency of it&mdash;in fact it all rather suited the
      sense of battle that there was in the air, so that the things seemed to
      say that they knew that there was a row on, and that they jolly well liked
      it. Freddie had been cross at dinner, and so, in so far as it was at all
      his room, the impression would not have been pleasant; but he just, one
      felt, slipped into bed and out of it, and there was an end of his being
      there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber, taking a few things off, putting a bright new dressing-gown
      on, and smiling from ear to ear, watched Isabel with burning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my dear!... No, just come and sit on the bed beside me and have
      these things off, and I've been much too busy to write about that
      skirt of mine that I told you I would, and there it is hanging up to shame
      me! Well! I'm just too glad, you dear!&rdquo; Here she hugged and
      kissed and patted her hand. &ldquo;And he is <i>such</i> a nice young man,
      although Freddie doesn't like him, you know, over the football or
      something, although I'm sure I never know what men's reasons
      are for disliking one another, and Freddie's especially; but I liked
      him ever since he dined here that night, although I didn't really
      see much of him because, you know, he played Bridge at the other table and
      I was <i>much</i> too worried!&rdquo; She drew a breath, and then added
      quite simply, like a child, and in that way of hers that was so perfectly
      fascinating: &ldquo;My dear, I love you, and I want you to be happy, and I
      think you will&mdash;and I want <i>you</i> to love me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel could only, for answer, fling her arms about her and hold her very
      tight indeed, and she felt in that little confession that there was more
      pathos than any one human being could realize and that life was terribly
      hard for some people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it is wonderful,&rdquo; she said at last, looking with
      her clear, beautiful eyes straight in front of her. &ldquo;One never knew
      how wonderful until it actually came. Love is more than the finest writer
      has ever said and not, I suspect, quite so much as the humblest lover has
      ever thought it&mdash;and that's pessimistic of me, I suppose,&rdquo;
      she added laughing; &ldquo;but it only means that I'm up to all the
      surprises and ready for them.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 'll find it exactly whatever you make it,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Comber said slowly. &ldquo;I don't think the other party has really
      very much to do with it. You never lose what you give, my dear; but, as a
      matter of fact he's the very nicest and trustiest young man, and no
      one could ever be a brute to you, whatever kind of brutes they were to
      anyone else&mdash;and I wish I'd remembered about that skirt.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence of the room and house, the peace of the night outside, came
      about Isabel like a comfortable cloak, so that she believed that
      everything was most splendidly right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Comber, &ldquo;tell me what this
      is that I hear about your young man and Mr. Perrin, because I only heard
      the veriest words from Freddie, and I was just talking to Jane at the time
      about not breathing when she's handing round the things, because she's
      always doing it, and she 'll have to go if she doesn't learn.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems the silliest affair,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and yet it's
      a great pity, because it may make a lot of trouble, I'm afraid. But
      that's why we announced our engagement to-day, because it 'll
      be, it appears, a case of taking sides.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It always is here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Comber, &ldquo;when there's
      the slightest opportunity of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it looks as though there was going to be plenty of
      opportunity this time,&rdquo; Isabel said sighing. &ldquo;It really is <i>too</i>
      silly. Apparently Archie took Mr. Perrin's umbrella to preparation
      in Upper School this morning without asking. They hadn't been
      getting on very well before, and when Mr. Perrin asked for his umbrella
      and Archie said that he'd taken it, there was a regular fight. The
      worst of it is that there were lots of people there; and now, of course,
      it is all over the school, and it will never be left alone as it ought to
      be.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Comber, solemnly, &ldquo;it will be the
      opportunity for all sorts of things. We 're all just ripe for it.
      How perfectly absurd of Mr. Perrin! But then he's an ass, and I
      always said so, and now it only proves it, and I wish he'd never
      come here. Of course you know that I'm with you, my dear; but I'm
      afraid that Freddie won't be, because he doesn't like your
      Archie, and there's no getting over it&mdash;and on whose side all
      the others will be there's no knowing whatever&mdash;and indeed I
      don't like to think of it all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so serious about it that Isabel at once became serious too. Her
      worst suspicions about it all were suddenly confirmed, so that the room,
      instead of its quiet and peace, was filled with a thousand sharp terrors
      and crawling fears. She was afraid of Mr. Perrin, she was afraid of the
      crowd of people, she was afraid of all the ill-feeling that promised soon
      to overwhelm her. She clutched Mrs. Comber's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;will they hate us?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They 'll do their best, my dear,&rdquo; said that lady
      solemnly, &ldquo;to hate somebody.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      And they came, comparatively in their multitudes, to tea on the next
      afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tuesday was, as it happened, Mrs. Comber's day, and the hour's
      relief that followed its ending scarcely outweighed the six days'
      terror at its horrible approach. Its disagreeable qualities were, of
      course, in the first place those of any &ldquo;at home&rdquo; whatever&mdash;the
      stilted and sterile fact of being there sacrificially for anyone to
      trample on in the presence of a delighted audience and a glittering
      tea-table. But in Mrs. Comber's case there was the additional
      trouble of &ldquo;town&rdquo; and &ldquo;school&rdquo; never in the least
      suiting, although &ldquo;town&rdquo; was only a question of local houses
      like the squire and the clergyman, and they ought to have combined, one
      would have thought, easily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      The society of small provincial towns has been made again and again the
      jest and mockery of satiric fiction, having, it is considered, in the
      quality of its conversation a certain tinkling and malicious chatter that
      is unequaled elsewhere. Far be it from me to describe the conversation of
      the ladies of Moffatt's in this way&mdash;it was a thing of far
      deeper and graver import.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impossibility of escape until the term's triumphant conclusion
      made what might, in a wider and finer hemisphere, have been simply
      malicious conversation that sprang up and disappeared without result, a
      perpetual battle of death and disaster. No slightest word but had its
      weightiest result, because everyone was so close upon everyone else that
      things said rebounded like peas flung against a board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber, at her tea-parties, had long ago ceased to consider the
      safety or danger of anything that she might say. It seemed to her that
      whatever she said always went wrong, and did the greatest damage that it
      was possible for any one thing to do; and now she counted her Tuesdays as
      days of certain disaster, allowing a dozen blunders to a Tuesday and
      hoping that she would &ldquo;get off,&rdquo; so to speak, on that. But on
      occasions like the present, when there was really something to talk about,
      she shuddered at the possible horrors; her line, of course, was strong
      enough, because it was Isabel first and Isabel last; and if that brought
      her into conflict with all the other ladies of the establishment, then she
      couldn't help it. Had it been merely a question of the Umbrella
      Riot, as some wit had already phrased it, she knew clearly enough where
      they were all likely to be; but now that there was Isabel's
      engagement as well, she felt that their anger would be stirred by that
      bright, young lady having made a step forward and having been, in some
      odd, obscure, feminine way, impertinently pushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wished passionately, as she sat in glorious purple before her silver,
      tea-things, her little pink cakes, and her vanishingly thin pieces of
      bread-and-butter, that the &ldquo;town&rdquo; would, on this occasion at
      any rate, put in an appearance, because that would prevent anyone really
      &ldquo;getting at&rdquo; things; but, of course, as it happened, the
      &ldquo;town&rdquo; for once wasn't there at all, and the battle
      raged quite splendidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The combatants were the two Misses Madder, Mrs. Dormer, and Mrs.
      Moy-Thompson, and it might seem that these ladies were not numerically
      enough to do any lastingly serious damage; but it was the bodies that they
      represented rather than the individuals that they actually were; and poor
      Mrs. Comber, as she smiled at them and talked at them and wished that the
      little pink cakes might poison them all, knew exactly the reason of their
      separate appearances and the danger that they were, severally and
      individually.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Misses Madder represented the matrons, and they represented them as
      securely and confidently as though they had sat in conclave already and
      drawn up a list of questions to be asked and answers to be given. Mrs.
      Dormer represented the wives and also, separately, Mrs. Dormer, in so far
      as her own especial dislike of Mrs. Comber went for everything; Mrs.
      Moy-Thompson, above all, faded, black, thin, and miserable, represented
      her lord and master, and was regarded by the other ladies as a spy whose
      accurate report of the afternoon's proceedings would send threads
      spinning from that dark little study for the rest of the term.
    </p>
    <p>
      The eldest Miss Madder, stout, good-natured, comfortable, had not of
      herself any malice at all; but her thin, bony sister, exact in her chair,
      and with eyes looking straight down her nose, influenced her stouter
      sister to a wonderful extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thin Miss Madder's remark on receiving her tea, &ldquo;Well, so
      Miss Desart's engaged to Mr. Traill!&rdquo; showed immediately which
      of the two pieces of news was considered the most important.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Comber, &ldquo;and I'm sure it's
      delightful. Do have one of those little pink cakes, Mrs. Thompson; they
      're quite fresh; and I want you especially to notice that little
      water-color over there by the screen, because I bought it in Truro last
      week for simply nothing at Pinner's, and I believe it's quite
      a good one&mdash;I'm sure we 're all delighted.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dormer wasn't so certain. &ldquo;They 're a little young,&rdquo;
      she said in so chilly a voice that she might have been suddenly
      transferred, against her will, in the dead of night in the thinnest
      attire, into the heart of Siberia. &ldquo;And what's this I hear
      from my husband about Mr. Perrin and Mr. Traill tumbling about on the
      floor together this morning&mdash;something about an umbrella?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Thompson, moving her chair a little closer,
      &ldquo;I heard something this morning about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber had never before disliked this thin, faded lady so intensely
      as she did on this afternoon&mdash;she seemed to chill the room with her
      presence; and the consciousness of the trouble that she would bring to
      various innocent persons in that place by the report of the things that
      they had said, made of her something inhuman and detached. Mrs. Comber's
      only way of easing the situation, &ldquo;Do have another little pink cake,
      Mrs. Thompson,&rdquo; failed altogether on this occasion, and she could
      only stare at her in a fascinated kind of horror until she realized with a
      start that she was intended as hostess to give an account of the morning's
      proceedings. But she turned to Miss Madder. &ldquo;You were down there,
      Miss Madder; tell us all about it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madder was only too ready, having been in the hall at the time and
      having heard what she called &ldquo;the first struggle,&rdquo; and having
      yielded eventually, rather against her better instincts, to her feminine
      curiosity&mdash;having in fact looked past the shoulders of Mr. Comber and
      Mr. Birkland and seen the gentlemen struggling on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Actually on the floor!&rdquo; said Mrs. Dormer, still in Siberia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, actually on the floor&mdash;also all the breakfast things and
      coffee all over the tablecloth.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madder was checked in her enthusiasm by her consciousness of the cold
      eye of Mrs. Thompson, and the possibility of being dismissed from her
      position at the end of the term if she said anything she oughtn't to&mdash;also
      the possibility of an unpleasant conversation with her clever sister
      afterwards. However, she considered it safe enough to offer it as her
      opinion that both gentlemen had forgotten themselves, and that Mr. Traill
      was very much younger than Mr. Perrin, although Mr. Perrin was the harder
      one to live with&mdash;and that it had been a clean tablecloth that
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it disgraceful,&rdquo; was the only light that the younger
      Miss Madder would throw upon the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment there was silence, and then Mrs. Dormer said, &ldquo;And
      really about an umbrella?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Miss Madder, who was warming to her work
      and beginning to forget Mrs. Thompson's eye, &ldquo;that Mr. Traill
      borrowed Mr. Perrin's umbrella without asking permission, and that
      there was a dispute.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was at once obvious that what interested the ladies was the
      question of Miss Desart's engagement to Mr. Traill, and the effect
      that that had upon the disturbance in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never quite liked Mr. Traill,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dormer decisively;
      &ldquo;and I cannot say that I altogether congratulate Miss Desart&mdash;and
      I must say that the quarrel of this morning looks a little as though Mr.
      Traill's temper was uncertain.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very uncertain indeed, I should think,&rdquo; said the younger Miss
      Madder with a sniff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber felt their eyes upon her; she knew that they wished to know
      what she had to say about it all, but she was wise enough to hold her
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other ladies then devoted all their energies upon getting an opinion
      from Mrs. Comber. During the next quarter of an hour, every lady
      understanding every other lady, a combined attack was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Semi-Chorus a</i>&mdash;The question of the umbrella was, of course, a
      question of order, and, as Mrs. Dormer put it, when a younger master
      attacks an older one and flings him to the ground, and rubs his hair in
      the dust and that before a large audience, the whole system of education
      is in danger; there 's no knowing when things will begin or end, and
      other masters will be doing dreadful things, and then the prefects, and
      then other boys, and finally a dreadful picture of the First and Second
      boys showing what they can do with knives and pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Madder entirely agreed with this, and then enlarged further on the
      question of property.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Semi-Chorus b</i>&mdash;One had one's things&mdash;here she was
      sure Mrs. Comber would agree&mdash;and if one didn't keep a tight
      hold of them in these days, one simply did n 't know where one would
      be. Of course one umbrella was a small thing; but, after all, it <i>was</i>
      aggravating on a wet morning not to find it and then to have no excuse
      whatever offered to one&mdash;anyone would be cross about it. And, after
      all, with some people if you gave them an inch they took an ell, as the
      saying was, and if one didn't show firmness over a small thing like
      this, it would only lead to people taking other things without asking
      until one really did n't know where one was. Of course, it was a
      pity that Mr. Perrin should have lost his self-control as completely as he
      appeared to have done, but nevertheless one could quite understand how
      aggravating it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Semi-Chorus a</i>&mdash;Mrs. Dormer, continued, keeping order was no
      light matter, and if those masters who had been in a school for twenty
      years were to be openly derided before boys and masters, if umbrellas were
      to be indiscriminately stolen, and if in fact anything was to be done by
      anybody at any time whatever without by your leave or for your leave, then
      one might just as well pack up one's boxes and go home; and then
      what would happen, one would like to know, to our schools, our boys, and
      finally, with an emphatic rattle of cup and saucer, to our country?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Semi-Chorus b</i>&mdash;Enlarged the original issue. It was really
      rather difficult when a young man had been behaving in this way to
      congratulate the young lady to whom he had just engaged himself. She was
      of course perfectly charming, but it was a pity that she should, whilst
      still so young, be forced to countenance disorder and tumult, because with
      that kind of beginning there was no telling what married life mightn't
      develop into.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Semi-Chorus a</i>&mdash;Enlarged yet again on this subject and, without
      mentioning names or being in any way specific, drew a dreadful picture of
      married lives that had been ruined simply through this question of
      discipline, and that if the husband were the kind of man who believed in
      blows and riot and general disturbance, then the wife was in for an
      exceedingly poor time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber had listened to this discussion in perfect silence. It was not
      her habit to listen to anything in perfect silence, but on the present
      occasion she continued to enforce in her mind that dark, ominous figure of
      Mrs. Thompson. Anything that she said would be used against her, and there
      in the corner, with her thin, white hands folded in her lap, with the
      black silk of her dress shining in little white lines where the light
      caught it, was the person who might undo her Freddie entirely. Whatever
      happened, she must keep silence&mdash;she told herself this again and
      again; but as Mrs. Dormer and Miss Madder continued, she found her anger
      rising. She fixed her eyes on the sharp, black feathers in Miss Madder's
      hat and tried to discuss with herself the general expense of the hat and
      why Miss Madder always wore things that didn't suit her, and whether
      Miss Madder wouldn't he ever so much better in a nice green grave
      with daisies and church bells in the distance, but these abstract
      questions refused to allow themselves to be discussed. She knew as she
      listened that Isabel, her dear, beloved Isabel, to whom she owed more than
      anyone in the whole world, was being attacked&mdash;cruelly, wickedly
      attacked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every word that came from their lips increased her rage: they hated Isabel&mdash;Isabel
      who had never done them any harm or hurt. As their voices, even and cold,
      went on, she forgot that dark, silent figure in the corner, and her hands
      began to twitch the silk of her purple gown. Suddenly in an instant
      Freddie was forgotten, everything was forgotten save Isabel, and she burst
      out, her eyes burning, her cheeks flaming: &ldquo;Really, Mrs. Dormer, you
      are a little inaccurate. I'm sure we must all agree that it's
      a pity if anyone is so silly as to knock someone else down because someone
      else has stolen one's umbrella, and I'm sure I should never
      want to; and indeed I remember quite well Miss Tweedy, who was matron here
      two years ago, taking a gray parasol of mine to chapel with her and
      putting it up before everybody, and nobody thought anything of it, and I
      remember Miss Tweedy being quite angry because I asked for it back again.
      I think it's very stupid of Mr. Perrin to make such a fuss about
      nothing, and I never did like him, and I don't care who knows it;
      but at any rate I don't see what this has all got to do with dear
      Isabel's engagement, and I think young Traill's a delightful
      fellow, and I hope they 'll both be enormously happy, and I think it's
      very unkind of you to wish them not to be!&rdquo; Mrs. Comber took a deep
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, my dear Mrs. Comber,&rdquo; said Mrs. Dormer very slowly,
      &ldquo;I'm sure we none of us wish them anything but happiness.
      Please don't have the impression that we are not eager for their
      good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help feeling, Mrs. Comber,&rdquo; said Miss Madder,
      &ldquo;that you have rather misunderstood our position in the matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm sure I'm very sorry if I have,&rdquo; broke
      in Mrs. Comber hurriedly, beginning already to be sorry that she had
      spoken so quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; went on Miss Madder, &ldquo;that I don't
      think we can any of us have two feelings about the question of discipline.
      I'm sure you agree with us there, Mrs. Comber.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course,&rdquo; said Mrs. Comber.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she saw at once that war had been declared. They hated Isabel, and
      they hated her; they would make it so unpleasant that Isabel would not be
      able to come and stay again&mdash;they were of one mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above all, after they had gone, there remained the impression of that
      silent, black lady who had said not a word. What would she tell
      Moy-Thompson? What harm would come to Freddie?
    </p>
    <p>
      Last, and worst of all, as Mrs. Comber most wretchedly reflected, Freddie
      had still to be faced.
    </p>
    <p>
      His feelings, she knew, would be strongly expressed, and were certainly
      not in a line with her own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the umbrella had a great deal to answer for!
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      And Freddie was, as a matter of fact, faced that very evening, and a
      crisis arrived in the affairs of the Combers which must be chronicled,
      because it had ultimately a good deal to do with Isabel and Archie Traill,
      and indeed with everyone in the present story.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whilst waiting for him downstairs, &ldquo;dressed and shining,&rdquo;
      as she used to like to say&mdash;with the dinner getting cold (for which
      disaster she was certain to be scolded)&mdash;she wondered in her muddled
      kind of way why it was that they should all have wanted to be so
      disagreeable, why, as a development of that, everyone always preferred to
      be disagreeable rather than pleasant. And she suddenly, facing the ormolu
      clock and the peacock screen with her eyes upon them as though they might,
      with their color and decoration help her, had a revelation&mdash;dim,
      misty, vague, and lost almost as soon as it was seen&mdash;that it wasn't
      really anyone's fault at all&mdash;that it was the system, the
      place, the tightness and closeness and helplessness that did for
      everybody; that nobody could escape from it, and that the finest saint,
      the most noble character, would be crushed and broken in that remorseless
      mill&mdash;&ldquo;the mills of the gods&rdquo;?&mdash;no, the mills of a
      rotten, impoverished, antiquated system.... She saw, staring at the clock
      and the screen and clinging to them, these men and these women, crushed,
      beaten, defeated: Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Dormer, Miss Madder, her own
      Freddie, Mr. Perrin, Mr. Birkland, Mr. White&mdash;even already young
      Traill&mdash;all of them decent, hopeful, brave... once. The coals clicked
      in the glowing fire, and the soft autumn wind passed down the darkening
      paths. She felt suddenly as though she must give it all up&mdash;she must
      leave Freddie and the children and go away... anywhere... she could not
      endure it any longer. And then Freddie came in, irritable, peevish,
      scarcely noticing her. Moy-Thompson had changed one of his hours, and that
      annoyed him; the soup of course was stone cold, the fish very little
      better. He scowled across the table at her, and she tried to be pleasant
      and amusing. Then suddenly he had launched into the umbrella affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young Traill wants kicking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What are we all
      coming to, I should like to know? Why, the man's only been here a
      month or two, and he goes and takes a senior master's things without
      asking leave, and then knocks him down because he objects. I never heard
      anything like it. The fellow wants kicking out altogether.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, why don't you say something? You've got some
      opinion about it, I suppose; and there's more in it than that&mdash;he's
      gone and got himself engaged to Isabel, I hear. What's the girl
      thinking of? They 're both much too young anyhow. It's absurd.
      I 'll tell her what I think of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, Freddie&mdash;don't say anything to her. She's
      so happy about it, and I'm sure the dear girl has been so good to
      both of us that she deserves some happiness, and I do want them to be
      successful. After all, if Mr. Traill was a little hasty, he's very
      young, and Mr. Perrin 's a very difficult man to get on with. You
      know, dear, you've always said&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whatever I 've said,&rdquo; he broke in furiously,
      &ldquo;I 've never advocated stealing nor hitting your elders and
      betters in the face, and if you think I have, you 're mightily
      mistaken.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      After that there was silence during the rest of the meal. Miss Desart was
      dining at the Squire's in the village, and, for once, Mrs. Comber
      was glad that the girl was not with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very near to tears. The day had been a most terrible one&mdash;and
      her food choked her. The meal seemed to stretch into infinity, the dreary
      dining-room, the monotonous tick of the clock, and always her husband's
      scowling face.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it was over, and he went to his study, and she to her little
      drawing-room. In front of her fire, her sewing slipped from her lap and
      she slept, with her purple dress shining in the firelight, and the rest of
      the room in shadow about her. And she dreamt wonderful dreams&mdash;of
      places where there was freedom and light, of hard, white roads and forests
      and cathedrals, and of a wonderful life where there was no travail nor
      ill-temper; and her face became happy again, and she saw Freddie as he had
      once been, before the shadow of this place had fallen about him, and in
      her dreams she was in a place where everyone loved her and she could make
      no mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she woke up and saw Freddie Comber standing near her, and she smiled
      at him and then gave a little exclamation because the fire was nearly out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, following her glance, &ldquo;it's a
      nice, cheerful room for a man to come into, isn't it, after he's
      tired and cold with work? I have got a nice, pleasant little wife. I'm
      a lucky man, I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as she began to busy herself with the fire, and tried to brighten
      it, he said, &ldquo;Oh! leave it now, can't you? What's the
      use of making a noise and fuss with it now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went on as she got up from her knees again and faced him, &ldquo;Look
      here, we've got to come to an understanding about this business.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What business?&rdquo; she said faintly, all the color leaving her
      cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, young Traill,&rdquo; he went on, standing over her. &ldquo;I'm
      not going to have my wife encouraging him in this affair. I tell you I
      object to him&mdash;he's a conceited, impertinent prig, and he wants
      putting in his place, and I 'll let him know it if he comes near
      here. I won't have him in the house, and it's just as well he
      should know it. So don't you go asking him here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She was now white to the lips. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have
      told Isabel that I am glad, and I <i>am</i> glad. I like Mr. Traill, and I
      don't think it was his fault in this business; and, Freddie dear,
      you know you are not quite fair to him because of his football, or
      something silly, and I'm sure you don't mind him, really&mdash;you
      don't like Mr. Perrin, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was quite the most unfortunate speech that poor Mrs. Comber could
      possibly have made; the mention of the football at once reminded Freddie
      Comber of all that he had suffered on that head, and his neck began to
      swell with rage, and his cheeks were flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, my lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you just leave things
      alone that don't belong to you. Never you mind what reasons I
      've got for disliking young Traill&mdash;it's enough if I say
      that he's not to come here&mdash;and Miss Isabel shall hear that
      from my own lips.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In all her long experience of him she had never known him so angry as he
      was now, and she had never before been so afraid of him; but at the
      mention of Isabel, she called all her courage to her aid and drew herself
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not do that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You cannot insult
      Isabel here, when she has been such a friend of ours, and been so good&mdash;so
      good. I love her, and the man she is going to marry is my friend.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said, speaking very low and coming very close to her.
      &ldquo;This is defiance, is it? You will do this and that, will you? I
      tell you that he shall not come here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I say that he shall,&rdquo; she answered in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with the accumulated irritation of the day upon him, he suddenly
      came to her and, muttering between his teeth, &ldquo;We 'll see
      about the master here,&rdquo; struck her so that he cut his hand on her
      brooch, and she fell back against the wall, and stayed there with her
      hands spread out against it, staring at him....
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence, with no sound save the clock and the distant
      wind. He had never, in their long married life, struck her before. They
      both knew, as they stood there staring at one another, that a period had
      suddenly been placed, like an iron wall, in their lives. Their relations
      could never be the same again. They might be better, they might be worse&mdash;they
      could never be the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with him there was a great overwhelming horror of what he had done.
      Her white face, her large, shining eyes, the way that her hands lay
      against the wall, and the way that her dress fell about her feet, because
      her knees were bending under her&mdash;drove this home to him. He was
      appalled; suddenly that man in him that had been dead for twenty years was
      brought to life by that blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear&mdash;my dear&mdash;don't look at me like that&mdash;I
      did not mean anything&mdash;I am not angry&mdash;I am terribly ashamed....
      Please&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was a trembling whisper. He put out his hand towards her. She
      took his hand, and came away from the wall, still looking at him fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never struck me before, Freddie,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;At
      least, you have never done that. I am so sorry, my dear.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, very quietly, she put her arms about his neck and kissed him; then
      she went slowly out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood where she had left him motionless. Then he said, still in a
      whisper and looking at the curtains that hid the night and the dark
      buildings. &ldquo;Curse the place! It is that&mdash;it has done for me....&rdquo;
      And then, as he very slowly sat down and faced the fire, he whispered to
      the shadowy room, &ldquo;I am no good&mdash;I am no good at all!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X&mdash;THE BATTLE OF THE UMBRELLA; &ldquo;WHOM THE GODS WISH TO
      DESTROY....&rdquo;
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>URING the month
      that followed, the battle raged furiously, and within a week of that
      original incident there was no one in the establishment who had not his or
      her especial grievance against someone else. In the Senior common room, at
      the middle morning hour, the whole staff might be seen, silent, grave,
      bending with sheer resolution over the daily papers, eloquent backs turned
      to their enemies, every now and again abstract sarcasm designed for some
      very concrete resting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      That original umbrella had, long ago, been forgotten, or, rather the
      original borrowing of it. It had now become a flag, a banner&mdash;something
      that stood for any kind of principle that it might serve one's
      purpose to support. One hated one's neighbor&mdash;well, let any
      small detail be the provocation, the battle was the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine, moreover, the effect on the young generation, assembled to watch
      and imitate the thoughts and actions of their elders and betters; what a
      delightful and admirable system!&mdash;with their Greek accents and verbs
      in with their principal parts of <i>savior</i> and <i>dire</i> and their
      conclusive decisions concerning vulgar fractions and the imports and
      exports of Sardinia, they should learn the delicate art of cutting your
      neighbor, of hating your fellow-creatures, of malicious misconception&mdash;all
      this within so small an area of ground, so slight a period of time, at so
      wonderfully inconsiderable an expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question at issue passed of course speedily to the very smallest boy
      in the school, but here there was not so intense a division&mdash;there
      was indeed scarcely a division at all, because there could not, on the
      whole, be two opinions about it. When it came to choosing between Old
      Pompous with his stupid manners and his uncertain temper, with all the
      custom of his twenty years' stay at the school so that he was simply
      a tiresome tradition that present fathers of grown families had once
      accepted as a fearful authority&mdash;between this and the novel and
      athletic Traill, with his splendid football and his easy fellowship...
      why? There was nothing more to be said. Why should n't one take Old
      Pompous's umbrella? Who was he to be so particular about his
      property? He would n't hesitate to take someone else's things
      if he wanted them.... Meanwhile there was an encouragement to rebellion
      amongst all those who came beneath his discipline&mdash;as to the way that
      he took this, there is more to be said later.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the point about this month is not the question of individual quarrel
      and disturbance. Of that there was enough and to spare, but there was
      nothing extraordinary about its progress, and every successive term saw
      something of the kind: the two questions as to whether Traill should have
      taken Perrin's umbrella and whether Isabel Desart should, under the
      circumstances, have allowed herself to be engaged to Traill, simply took
      the place of other questions that had, in their time, served to rouse
      combat. No&mdash;the peculiar fact about this month was that at the end of
      it, when their quarrels and hatreds should have reached their climax, they
      were sunk suddenly almost to the point of disappearance&mdash;they were
      almost lost and forgotten&mdash;and the reason of this was that everyone
      in the place, in some cases unconsciously and in nearly every instance
      silently, was watching Perrin.... It had become during that time an issue
      between two men, and one of those men was passive. It was being worked out
      in silence&mdash;even the spectators themselves made no comment, but Mrs.
      Comber afterwards put it into words when she said that &ldquo;Everyone was
      so afraid that talking about it might make it happen that no one said
      anything at all&rdquo;&mdash;and that indeed was the remarkable fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst all the eyes that were turned on the developing incident those
      most fitted for our purpose of elucidation belonged to Isabel Desart, and
      her experience of it all will do very well for everyone else's
      experience of it, because the only difference between herself and the rest
      was that she was more acute in her judgment and had a more discerning
      intuition.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place she had very crucially indeed to fight her own battles.
      It did not take her a day to discover that every lady in the place, with
      the single exception of Mrs. Comber, was, for the time being at any rate,
      up in arms against her. She ought not to have allowed herself to be
      engaged to Mr. Traill&mdash;there were no two opinions about it. It was
      not ladylike&mdash;she was allying herself, to disorder and tumult, she
      was encouraging the stealing of things, and the knocking down of persons
      in authority&mdash;above all, she was setting herself up, whatever that
      might mean: all this was foreshadowed on the very first day in Mrs. Comber's
      drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things did not, in the very least, surprise or dismay Isabel. She
      loved a battle&mdash;she had never realized before how dearly she loved
      it, she gave no quarter and she asked none. She went about with her head
      up and her eyes flashing fire&mdash;she was quiet unless she was attacked;
      but so soon as there were signs of the enemy, the armor would be buckled
      on and the trumpet sounded. In a way&mdash;and it seemed to her curious
      when she looked back upon it&mdash;this month of hers was stirring and
      even rather delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were other and more serious sides to it. She saw at once that
      something had happened in the Comber family, and with all the tenderness
      and gentleness that was so wonderfully hers she sought to put it right.
      But she soon realized that it had all gone far too deep for any outside
      help. She did not know what had occurred on that evening when she had
      dined at the Squire's. Mrs. Comber told her nothing&mdash;she only
      begged her not to speak to Freddie about the umbrella quarrel and not to
      attempt to bring Archie to the house, at present at any rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Comber was now a different person&mdash;her animated volubility
      had disappeared altogether, she went about her house very quietly with a
      pale face and tired eyes, and she did not speak unless she was spoken to.
      But the change in Freddie Comber was still more marked. Isabel had never
      liked him so much before. His harsh dogmatism seemed to have disappeared.
      He said very little to anybody, but in his own house at any rate he was
      quiet, reserved, and even submissive. Isabel noticed that he was on the
      watch to do things for his wife, and sometimes she saw that his eyes would
      leave his work and stray about the room as though he were searching for
      something. He scarcely seemed to notice her at all, and sometimes when she
      spoke to him he would start and look at her curiously, almost
      suspiciously, as though he were wondering how much she knew. He was not
      kind and attentive to her, as he had been before&mdash;she felt sure that
      he had now a great dislike for her. All this made her miserable, and she
      loved to wonder sometimes what it was that held her back from speaking to
      Mrs. Comber about it all&mdash;but something prevented her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The masters, she knew, were divided about her. They were, she thought,
      more occupied with their own quarrels and disputes than with any attitude
      towards herself. At first she was amused by their divided camps&mdash;it
      all seemed so childish and absurd, and for its very childishness it could
      not have a serious conclusion; but as the days went on and she saw into it
      all more deeply, the pathos of it caught her heart and she could have
      cried to think of what men they might have been, of the things that they
      might have done. Some of them seemed to seek her out now with a
      courtliness and deference that they had never shown her before. Birkland,
      of whom she had always been rather frightened, spoke to her now whenever
      there was an opportunity, and his sharp, sarcastic eyes softened, and she
      saw the sadness in their gray depths, and she felt in the pressure of his
      hands that he wanted now to be friends with her. White, too, was different
      now. He said very little to her, and he was so quiet that for him to speak
      at all was a wonderful thing, but there were a few words about his
      affection for Archie.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all of this Isabel got a profound sense of its being her duty to do
      something; as far as her own affairs were concerned she was perfectly able
      to manage them, and if the matter in dispute had been simply her
      engagement to Archie, there would be no difficulty&mdash;it was a case of
      waiting, and then escaping; but things were more serious than that&mdash;something
      was in the air, and she knew enough of that life and that atmosphere to be
      afraid. But it was not until later than this that she began to be afraid
      definitely of Mr. Perrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this feeling that she had of the necessity of doing something grew
      when she perceived the inertia of the others&mdash;inertia was perhaps
      scarcely the word: it was rather, as the matter advanced, an increasing
      impulse to sink their own quarrels and sit back in the chairs and wait for
      the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with this before her, Isabel set out on a determined campaign, having
      for its ultimate issue the hope of possible reconciliation&mdash;she could
      not put it more optimistically than that&mdash;before the end of the term
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not at all a desire to do good that drove her&mdash;indeed, her
      flashing disputes with Mrs. Dormer, her skirmishes with the younger Miss
      Madder, were very far away from any evangelistic principles whatever&mdash;but
      rather some hint of future trouble that was hard to explain. She wished to
      prevent things happening, was the way that she herself would have put it;
      but that did not hinder her from feeling a natural anxiety that Miss
      Madder, Mrs. Dormer, and the rest should have some of their own shots back
      before the end of the term was reached.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      But she began her campaign with her own Archie, and found him difficult.
      Going down the hill by the village on one of those sharp, tightly drawn
      days with the horizon set like marble and nothing moving save the brittle
      leaves blowing like brown ghosts up and down, she tried to get him to see
      the difficulties as she saw them, She attacked him at first on the
      question of making peace with Mr. Perrin, and came up at once against a
      bristling host of obstinacies and traditions that her ignorance of public
      school and university laws had formerly hidden from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin was a bounder, and young Traill's eyes were cold and hard as
      he summed it all up in this sentence. He would do anything in the world
      for Isabel, but she did n't probably altogether understand what a
      fellow felt&mdash;there were things a man couldn't do. She found
      that the laws of the Medes and Persians were nothing at all in comparison
      with the stone tables of public school custom: &ldquo;The man was a
      bounder&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;There were things a fellow couldn't do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not expected him to go and beg for peace&mdash;she had not
      probably altogether wished him to; but the way that he looked at it all
      left her with a curious mixture of feelings: she felt that he was so
      immensely young, and therefore to be&mdash;most delightful of duties&mdash;looked
      after. Also she felt, for the first time, all the purpose and obstinacy of
      his nature, so that she foresaw that there would in the future between
      them be a great many tussles and battles.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was very much cleverer than he was, and dealt with him very
      gently, and then suddenly gave him a sharp, little moral rap, and then
      kissed him afterwards. She found, in fact, that this trouble with Mr.
      Perrin was worrying him dreadfully. He hid it as well as he could, and hid
      it on the whole very successfully; but Isabel dragged it all out and saw
      that he hated quarreling with anybody, and that he now dimly discovered
      that he was the center of a vulgar dispute and that people were taking
      sides about him&mdash;all this was horrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He also felt very strongly the injustice of it. &ldquo;I never meant to
      knock the fellow down. I never knew I'd taken his beastly umbrella&mdash;all
      this fuss!&rdquo;&mdash;which was, Isabel thought, so very like a man,
      because the thing was done and there was no more to be said about it. He
      thought a great deal about her in the matter and was very anxious to stand
      up for her; indeed, that was the only aspect of the affair that gave him
      any satisfaction&mdash;that they should be fighting shoulder to shoulder
      against the &ldquo;low, bounding&rdquo; world, and he declared, as he
      looked at her, that he loved her more and more every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all of this did not touch on his relations with Perrin, and his eyes
      with regard to that gentleman could only look one way&mdash;he would not
      make advances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more Isabel felt his determination, the more, curiously enough, she
      felt Mr. Perrin's pathos. She had not yet arrived at the definite
      watching of him that was to come upon them all soon so curiously; but when
      she thought of him she thought of Archie's definition of him, and
      she realized, as she had not realized before, that that would be a great
      many other persons' definition of him also. Whatever he was&mdash;cross,
      irritable, violent, even wicked&mdash;he was, at any rate, lonely, and
      that was enough to make Isabel sorry, and more than sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not, of course, make Archie see that. &ldquo;The fellow's
      always wanted to be lonely&mdash;thinks himself much too good for other
      people's society, that's the fact, and if a man behaves like a
      beast, he must expect to be left alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>That</i> did not worry Archie. The whole of his annoyance arose from
      the fact that there should be such a fuss. He had never really quarreled
      with anyone before&mdash;people <i>never</i> did quarrel with him; and now
      suddenly here were Comber and West and the little French worm Pons, stiff
      and sulky whenever they met him, and Moy-Thompson bullying him whenever he
      got the opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course he wasn't going to stay! he couldn't stay under
      these circumstances&mdash;but it was all unpleasant and disagreeable.
      Isabel herself was only too anxious to take him out of it all as soon as
      possible. He wasn't wearing well under it. He had been full of light
      and sunshine at the beginning of the term, pleasant to everyone, equable,
      comfortable, a splendid creature to be with. Now the boys of his class
      found that nothing pleased him, little things roused him to a fury, and he
      snapped at people when they spoke to him. With Isabel he was always
      gentle, but his eager eyes were tired, and once he wasn't very far
      away from tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not allow any of these things to worry her. She was proud with
      Miss Madder, haughty with Moy-Thompson, gentle with Mrs. Comber, always
      amusing and cheerful with Archie. But when she had gone to bed and was at
      last alone, she would lie there, trying to puzzle it all out, afraid of
      what the future might bring, and praying that she might drag Archie out of
      it all before they had damaged him. He was such a boy, and all this
      discussion was so new to him; but she felt that she herself was ninety at
      least, and she would wonder sometimes that all men's difficult
      education seemed to leave them just where they began, which was several
      stages earlier than the place where women commenced. Love and death were
      very simple things, it seemed to her, beside the tangled daily worries of
      people getting along together. Her present feeling was something akin to
      Alice's sensation at the Croquet party when the hoops (being
      flamingoes) would walk away and climb up trees, and the balls (being
      hedge-hogs) would wander off the ground. They were all flamingoes and
      hedge-hogs at Moffatt's.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      But towards the end of this month, Isabel became suddenly conscious of Mr.
      Perrin in a very different way. It was now only three weeks before the end
      of term, and in another week examinations would begin. That something in
      the atmosphere that signified the coming of examinations was busy about
      the place. People were very quiet, and then suddenly in the most singular
      way would break out; there was continual quarreling in the common room,
      strange rumors were carried of things that people had said&mdash;it was
      all a question of strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came, it now being the first week in December, the first day of
      snow, and the light, feathery flakes fell throughout the afternoon, and
      when the sun set there was a soft, white world with the buildings black
      and grim and a sky of hurrying gray cloud. Isabel and Mrs. Comber sat in
      Mrs. Comber's little drawing-room over a roaring fire, and there was
      no other light in the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber sat, as she so often sat now, with her chin resting in her
      hand, silently staring at the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel was unhappy; the silent whiteness of the world outside, the
      consciousness of Miss Madder's rudeness to her that afternoon, the
      trouble that she had seen in Archie's eyes when she had said good
      night to him after Chapel, above all, a general sense of strain and nerves
      stretched to breaking-point&mdash;all this overwhelmed her. She had never
      felt so strongly before that she and Archie, if they were to keep anything
      at all of their vitality, must escape at once... to-night... to-morrow; it
      might be too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew that Archie had lost his temper with West that afternoon, that he
      had called him a &ldquo;rotten little counter-jumper,&rdquo; and that West
      had made an allusion to &ldquo;stealing things.&rdquo; Where were they
      all? What were they all doing to be fighting like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat in silence opposite to one another, one on each side of the fire,
      and the ticking of the clock, and every now and again a tumbling coal,
      were the only sounds. Then suddenly Isabel broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I can't stand it any longer; I feel as though I should go
      mad. What is the matter with everybody? Why are we all fighting like this?
      Oh! I <i>do</i> want to be pleasant to somebody again, just for a change.
      For the last three weeks, ever since that wretched quarrel, there has been
      no peace at all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Mrs. Comber answered without raising her eyes from
      the fire; &ldquo;I am very tired, too, and it's a good thing there
      are only three weeks more of the term, because I 'm sure that
      somebody would be cutting somebody's throat if it lasted any longer,
      and I wouldn't mind very much if somebody would cut mine.&rdquo; She
      gave a little choke in her throat, and then suddenly her head fell forward
      into her hands, and she burst into passionate sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isabel said nothing, but came over to her and knelt down by her chair and
      took her other hand. They stayed together in silence for a long time, and
      the burning fire flung great shadows on the walls, and the snow had begun
      to fall again and rustled very softly and gently against the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Mrs. Comber looked up and wiped her eyes, and tried to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! my dear! you are so good to me. I don't know what I
      should have done this terrible term if you hadn't been, and now my
      eyes are a perfect sight, and Freddie will be coming in; but I could n't
      help it. Things only seem to get worse and worse and worse, and I've
      stood it as long as I can, and I can't stand it any longer. I think
      I shall go away and be a nun or a hospital nurse or something where you
      're let alone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Mrs. Comber;&rdquo; said Isabel, still holding her hand,
      &ldquo;do tell me about these last few weeks, if it would help you. Of
      course, I 've seen that something 's happened between you and
      Mr. Comber. I can see that he is most dreadfully sorry about something,
      and I know that he wants to make it up. But this silence is worse than
      anything, and if you 'd only have it out, both of you, I'm
      sure it would get all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear.&rdquo; Mrs. Comber shook her head and wiped her eyes.
      &ldquo;It's not that so much. Freddie and I will get all right
      again, I expect, and even be better together than we were be-for; but all
      this business has shown me, my dear, that I'm a failure. I 've
      known it really all the time, and I used to pretend that if one was nice
      enough to people one could n't be altogether a failure, because they
      wanted one to like them&mdash;and that's the truth. Nobody wants me
      to like them, and I'm the loneliest woman in the world. I'm
      not grumbling about it, because I suppose I'm careless and silly and
      untidy, but I don't think anyone's wanted friends quite so
      badly as I have, and some people have such a lot. I used to think it was
      all just accidents, but now I know it's really me; and now you
      're going to be married there's an end of you, the only person
      I had.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Archie and I,&rdquo; said Isabel softly, &ldquo;will care for you
      to the end of your days, and you will come and stay with us, won't
      you? And you know that Freddie loves you. Why, I 've seen him
      looking at you during these last weeks as though he could die for you, and
      then he's been afraid to say anything. It's only this horrid
      place that has got in the way so dreadfully.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber caught her hand eagerly. &ldquo;Do you really think so, my
      dear? Oh! if I could only think that, because I have fancied he's
      been different lately, and he's such a dear when he likes to be and
      is n't worried about his form; but things are always worse at
      examination time, and I always pray that the two weeks may be got through
      as quickly as possible; and something <i>dreadful did</i> happen the other
      day, and I know he was ashamed of himself, the poor dear.... Perhaps
      things will be all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber gave a great sigh and looked a little more cheerful. Then,
      after a pause, she began again, but a little doubtfully: &ldquo;You know,
      Isabel dear, there's something else. I don't want to frighten
      you, but Mrs. Dormer noticed it as well, and I know it's silly of
      me, but I don't quite like it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;Well, Mr. Perrin; he's
      been looking so queer ever since that quarrel with your Archie. I daresay
      you haven't noticed anything, and I daresay it may be all my own
      imaginations, and I'm sure in a place like this one might imagine
      anything&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does he look queer,&rdquo; said Isabel quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's his eyes, I suppose, and the things the boys say
      about him. You know, my dear, I've wondered since whether perhaps he
      didn't care about you rather a great deal, and whether that isn't
      another reason for his disliking Archie&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care about me?&rdquo; said Isabel laughing; &ldquo;why, no, of
      course not. He's only spoken to me once or twice.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Comber, &ldquo;I've seen him looking
      at you in the strangest way in chapel. And his face has got so white and
      thin and drawn, I'm really quite sorry for the poor man. And his
      eyes are so odd, as though he was trying to see something that wasn't
      there. And the boys say that he's so strange in class sometimes and
      stops suddenly in the middle of a lesson and forgets where he is; and Mr.
      Clinton was telling me that he never speaks to Archie, but sometimes when
      Archie's there he gets very white and shakes all over and leaves the
      room. I only want you to warn Archie to be careful, because when a man's
      lonely like that and begins to think about things, he might do anything.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what could he do?&rdquo; Isabel said, with a little catch in
      her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Comber said rather
      uncertainly. &ldquo;Only when examinations come on they do seem to get
      into the men's heads so, and it's only that I thought that
      Archie might be careful and ready if Mr. Perrin seemed odd at all...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber left it all very uncertain, and as they sat silently in the
      room with the fire turning from a roaring blaze into a golden cavern and
      the shadows on the wall growing smaller and smaller as the fire fell,
      Isabel seemed to feel the cold black and white of the world outside gather
      ominously about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said good night very quietly, and the two women clung to each other a
      moment longer than usual, as though they did not wish to leave each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Isabel, &ldquo;whatever else this place
      may do, it can't alter our being together. You 've always got
      me, you know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But from this moment Isabel was afraid. Perhaps her nerves were strained,
      perhaps she saw a great deal more than there was to be seen; but she
      longed for the end of the term with a passionate eagerness, and she could
      not sleep at nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, curiously, on the very next morning Mr. Perrin came and spoke to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She always afterwards remembered him as she saw him that day. She was just
      turning out of the black gate to go down the hill to the village; there
      was a very pale blue sky; the ground was white with gray and purple
      shadows, and the houses were brown and sharply edged, as though cut out of
      paper, in the distance; the hills were a gray-white against the sky. He
      came towards her very slowly, and she saw that he wanted to speak to her,
      so she stopped and waited for him. When he came up to her&mdash;with his
      gown hanging loosely about him and his heavy, black mortar-board, with his
      thin, haggard cheeks, and staring eyes, with his straggly, unkept mustache&mdash;she
      had a moment of ungovernable fear. She could give no reason for it, but
      she knew that her impulse was to turn and run away, anywhere so that she
      might escape from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she controlled herself and turned and faced him, and smiled and held
      out her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could see him staring beyond her, over her shoulder, with eyes that
      didn't see her at all. She saw that his hand was shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Perrin? I haven't seen you for quite a
      long time. Isn't this snow delightful? If it will only stay like
      this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he came quite close to her, looking into her eyes; he grasped her
      hand and held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 've been wanting to say...&rdquo; he said in an odd voice,
      and there he stopped and stood staring at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      His throat was moving convulsively, and he put his hand up to his face
      with a helpless gesture and pulled his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've wanted to say&mdash;um, ah&mdash;to congratulate you...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared his throat, and suddenly she saw tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! thank you!&rdquo; she said impulsively, coming up to him and
      putting her hand on his arm. &ldquo;Thank you so very much!&rdquo; and
      then she could say no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved his arm away, and his eyes passed her again, out of the distant
      horizon. Then he said very rapidly, as though he were reciting a speech
      that he had learnt, &ldquo;I wanted to congratulate you on your
      engagement. I hope you 'll be very happy. I'm sure you will. I'm
      afraid I 'm a little late in my good wishes. I'm afraid I'm
      a little late. Yes. Good morning!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, before she could say any more, he had moved away and gone down the
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she watched his black gown waving a little behind him she knew that her
      vague fears of the night before had taken definite form.

      CHAPTER XI&mdash;MR. PERRIN SEES DOUBLE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>EANWHILE, many
      things had happened to Mr. Perrin during this month. On that night after
      Clinton had told him about Miss Desart's engagement to Traill, he
      did not go to bed for many hours, but sat over his black grate without
      moving until the morning. He did not know until this had happened to him
      how greatly he had valued his dreams. To every man in middle life there
      comes a day when he sees clearly and pitilessly that he has missed
      ambitions, or, if he has gained them, that there were other ambitions that
      would have been more profitable of pursuit; and then, if the rest of his
      days are to be worthily and honorably spent, he must make reckoning with
      other things that have perhaps no glitter nor promise, but will give him
      enough&mdash;life has no compensation for cynics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that black night, the darkest night of his life, Perrin saw that his
      last claim to that chance to which he had clung from his earliest boyhood,
      was gone. At first, in the blind pathos of his disappointment, it seemed
      to him that she had promised to marry him and had left him at the altar. A
      great wave of self-pity swept over him, and he sat with his head in his
      hands, and the tears trickled through his thin fingers. The things that he
      could have done had she been faithful to him!&mdash;that was the way he
      put it. He saw now scenes that had occurred between them. He had pleaded
      his love, and she had accepted him; her head had rested on his breast,
      and, in that very room, he had held her and kissed her and stroked her
      hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, slowly, as the room grew colder and the faint gray dawn came in
      at the window, he knew that that was not true; she had never cared about
      him, she had scarcely spoken to him; how could she care for a man like him&mdash;that
      sort of creature?
    </p>
    <p>
      What had God meant by making a man like that? It was His game, perhaps; it
      pleased Him perhaps to have some ridiculous animal there that other men
      might sport with it&mdash;other beardless boys like Traill....
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that he would like to take his revenge on God. He would show God
      that he was not the kind of man to be played with like that&mdash;he would
      mock at Him and show that he didn't care, that he was not afraid&mdash;ah!
      but he <i>was</i> afraid, terribly afraid. He had always been afraid since
      those days when, a very small boy in short trousers, he had sat listening
      to the clergyman who had painted pictures of hell with such lurid and
      wonderful accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      God was like that&mdash;He took away from you all the things that made
      life worth living, and then punished you with eternal fire afterwards
      because you resented His behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin was not crying now, because his head was aching so badly that
      the pain of it prevented any tears. He was sitting with his eyes very
      large and bright and his cheeks very white and drawn. When his head ached,
      it always meant that that other Mr. Perrin whose appearances he had now so
      long attempted to control came creeping out&mdash;that other Mr. Perrin
      who did not want him to have his chance, that other Mr. Perrin whom he did
      not want his friends to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this night for the first time in his life that other Mr. Perrin seemed
      to have a concrete appearance and form. He was standing, Mr. Perrin
      fancied, somewhere in the corner of the room, and he was watching. He was
      wearing the same clothes, and he had the same features, but it was an evil
      face&mdash;all the eyes and nose and mouth and ears had gone wrong. Mr.
      Perrin had kept him in control so long; but now at last he had broken out,
      and perhaps he would never go away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin was dreadfully afraid that he had come to stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, as the minutes passed, Mr. Perrin was conscious that there was
      something that this other Mr. Perrin wanted him to do. It had some
      connection with that young Traill. Mr. Perrin was conscious that now, as
      he thought of him, he had no anger in his brain about young Traill. No,
      there was nothing to be angry about&mdash;of course not&mdash;no; but he
      knew that there was something that the other Mr. Perrin thought that he
      ought to do to young Traill. What was it?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, very slowly, as though he were awaking out of a bad dream, Mr.
      Perrin pulled himself together. That other Mr. Perrin passed from the
      room, and the cold gray dawn crept across the floor. He was very desolate
      and very unhappy. He thought perhaps he would kill himself, and so end it
      all. What did people do? They hung themselves, or they shot themselves, or
      they poisoned themselves. No, he knew that he would be afraid to do any of
      those things. He was afraid of the pain and also, in an inconsequent way,
      of the sight that he would look afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came to him the curious, strange idea that perhaps this was his
      great chance&mdash;the chance that he had been waiting for all his life.
      Perhaps God intended to knock him down as far as He could, so as to give
      him the opportunity of rising. Supposing he rose now, supposing he showed
      them that he did not care about Miss Desart or young Traill, supposing he
      won a fine position and did magnificently... but then, of course, it was
      absurd; after twenty years in Moffatt's one did not &ldquo;do&rdquo;
      magnificently anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      No, he was no good&mdash;he was done for. He thought, as he heard the
      clock strike five, he would go to bed. And then he lay there, staring at
      the yellow flowers on the wall-paper. There were five in a row, and then
      four, and then three, and then two, and then five again.... They were ugly
      flowers. He wanted Miss Desart! he wanted Miss Desart! he wanted Miss
      Desart! He bit the pillow and lay with his face buried in it, his thin,
      sharp shoulders heaving.... He wanted Miss Desart!...
    </p>
    <p>
      His misery came upon him now in great clouds, and it buffeted him and
      enveloped him, and left him at last weak and shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Traill had done this&mdash;young Traill was his enemy... young
      Traill! He hated him, and would do him harm if he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, across the gray floor, outlined against the yellow paper
      flowers, he saw once more the gray figure of the other Mr. Perrin.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      But when the morning came, and as the days passed, he found that it all
      resolved itself into an effort to keep control. This was very hard. When
      he had been a small boy there had been a picture that used to hang in his
      mother's dining-room. It was a gray picture of a skeleton that sat
      with a grin on its ghastly face on a huge iron chest studded with great
      black nails. The lid was raised a little, and from under it peeped the
      eyes of some wretched man, and over the edge there hung a grasping,
      wrenching hand. Someone was in there, someone was trying to get out, and
      the skeleton was sitting on the box....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like that now with Mr. Perrin; there was something in him that was
      trying to get out, and he was determined that it should not. He found at
      once that he could not bear to be in the same room with Traill, and as the
      days advanced this feeling did not decrease. The feeling inside him that
      he must not let out was always stronger and more violent when Traill was
      there. Of course they did not speak to one another, but it was something
      more active than mere silent avoidance. They had struggled on the floor
      together, struggled before Comber and Birkland&mdash;Perrin would not
      forget that. He remembered it as an act of faith and said to himself a
      great many times. He always found that when he was in the room with Traill
      something seemed to drag him across the floor towards him, and he had to
      hold himself back.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all very difficult, and he found it very hard to keep his mind on
      his form. It was more necessary than ever to keep his mind on his form,
      because he fancied that there was a new spirit abroad amongst them. They
      must, of course, have heard all about the quarrel, and he thought that
      when he was with them they laughed at him and mocked amongst themselves.
      They had always done that of course, but now there was an added reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one thing that they did at the Lower School that he always
      hated. When the bell rang at five minutes to one for luncheon, the master
      who was on duty was supposed to station himself at the door of the hall
      and look at the boys' hands, as the boys filed in, to see whether
      they were clean. Perrin had always hated doing this; it had seemed to him
      most undignified, and the sight of fifty pairs of hands raised to his
      eyes, one after the other&mdash;hands that were ill-kept, bitten, and
      ragged, and torn&mdash;this had been, in some bidden way, irritating. Now
      it was much more irritating, so that when it was his week on duty and this
      horde of boys passed him, raising their hands, as it seemed to him, with
      insolence and levity, he wanted to scream, to beat them all down, to run
      amok amongst them, to trample until all the hands were broken and
      bleeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Garden Minimus had often been turned back for having dirty hands. He used
      to try to slip through with the crowd, and Perrin had called him up, and
      he had come with a twinkling smile, and his hands had been very inky. Then
      Perrin, with apparent austerity, but in reality with a kindly eye, had
      sent him back to wash. But now the boy made no attempt to escape, but with
      a grave, serious face passed slowly along; his hands were always
      beautifully clean&mdash;he did not look at Perrin. This was, of course, a
      very small affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But afterwards, when they had all passed in, when they stood silently
      behind their forms and he began the Latin grace and at the end &ldquo;per
      Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum&rdquo; and a great clatter of forms being
      dragged out and people sitting down and the hum of voices&mdash;then he
      wanted to run amongst them and strike their stupid faces, but he knew that
      he must not.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day at the very beginning he had suddenly found that he was alone in
      the Junior-Common room with Traill, and Traill had begun to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill was standing away from him at the window, and he scarcely turned
      his head, but over his shoulder in a gruff voice: &ldquo;I say, Perrin,
      isn't this rather rot, our quarreling like this? I hate not to be
      speaking to a fellow&mdash;I'm sorry if I did things, but you know&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And Perrin, with his head a little lowered and his hands swinging, had
      moved towards him, making a curious little noise in his throat, and Traill
      had seen his face and stepped back against the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Perrin had remembered that picture in his mother's dining-room.
      No! that man must not get out&mdash;he must at all costs be kept in his
      box. And so he had turned and left the room without saying anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill did not try to speak to him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his form during these days Perrin was very quiet. It was remarked
      afterwards how quiet he had been. He was never angry. Boys did bad work,
      and he did not seem to mind, but he looked at them in a strange way and
      said, &ldquo;Go back, and do it again&mdash;do it again,&rdquo; as though
      he were not thinking of what he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps he did not altogether realize them during those days, but rather
      thought of them as faces and boots. There were faces in a row, white
      faces, and then there was a long strip of wooden desk, scarred with ink,
      and then there were boots, broad-toed boots, sometimes with laces hanging
      down, stupid things like toads.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had taught the things that he taught so often that it needed no effort
      now to think of them. When you began with numbers on the board, other
      numbers followed, and then an answer, and a face got five marks if it was
      right&mdash;that was all. He never spoke to Garden Minimus if he could
      help it. He did not analyze his silence&mdash;it was merely a fact that he
      did not wish to have Garden Minimus's face brought too close to his
      own... it reminded him of things that hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on the whole, his form did not notice any delightful difference
      except that there was a visible slackening of authority. One could do
      things with pens and ink and other people's books more often than
      had hitherto been the case, and Somerset-Walpole perhaps felt the
      difference more severely than anyone else.... That was really all that
      there was to say about his form.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perhaps about a week after the Battle of the Umbrella broke out
      that Perrin noticed two things. The first thing that he noticed was that
      he saw Traill when Traill wasn't there. This was very odd and very
      provoking. It could not be said with real accuracy that he saw him,
      because he was always just round the corner and out of his eye. One
      morning during an Algebra hour, sitting at his desk, he suddenly felt that
      Traill was standing just inside the door. It was very odd of Traill to do
      this, because he ought, by rights, to have been teaching at the Upper
      School&mdash;moreover, the door had apparently made no sound when it
      opened and none of the boys seemed to notice his entrance; also Mr. Perrin
      could not be quite sure, because he was not looking at the door at all but
      at the board in front of him. He knew exactly how Traill was standing, and
      at last, his motionless silence was so irritating that he turned round
      sharply and looked at the door, but Traill was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence that was between them, the elaborate prevention of
      conversation when they were together at meals or in a room, came slowly to
      Perrin as an added impertinence. He knew now that he hated Traill with all
      his heart and soul, but that was a very mild way of putting it. It was not
      hatred that he felt when he found Traill's face opposite him at
      dinner: it was something more active than that. It was as though someone
      at his elbow was urging him to leap across the table, dragging the cloth
      with him as he went, and to catch Traill's throat... and to do
      things; but he knew that he must not, because something must be kept in a
      box. And the other thing that he noticed about this time was that people
      were talking about him. This might almost be called the Irritation of the
      Closed Door, because on every occasion that he saw a closed door&mdash;and
      they were very many&mdash;he knew that there were people behind it who
      were talking about him. Sometimes he suddenly opened, very softly, a door
      and looked, and although there was, as a rule, no one in the room, he was
      sure that they were hiding in cupboards and behind chairs. Once when he
      opened a door suddenly like that, the stout Miss Madden was alone in the
      room, sewing, and when she saw him she dropped her work and screamed,
      which was foolish of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they were all of them always talking about him, and he would like to
      have heard what they said. He wondered what Miss Desart said&mdash;he was
      sure that she would be kind&mdash;and he stared at her very hard in
      chapel, because he saw her so very little at other times, and because he
      would like to know what she was thinking about. He would like to know
      whether it was about the same things as his things&mdash;and so he stared
      at her in a curious way.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then one evening he suddenly discovered that it was the day on which
      he wrote to his mother. He had omitted to write to her last week for the
      first time for very many years, because he had forgotten, and she had
      written saying how much she had missed it&mdash;so he must not forget it
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had a very trying day, and the man in the box had more nearly
      broken out than ever before, so that at first it was very hard to think of
      his mother at all. But he stood in the middle of the room with his hands
      to his throbbing head, and he made in his mind a little picture of her
      sitting in her lace cap and black gown, waiting for a letter from him. He
      sat down in his chair and lit his lamp and took out his pen and paper and
      began, as he had begun for a great many years:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear old lady...
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly he thought that Traill was in the room, standing, as he did
      now, just inside the door. He turned sharply in his chair and held the
      lamp up towards the door, but there was no one there. He sat with his head
      between his hands and cleared his mind of everything except his mother;
      and gradually, as he sat there, all that strange state that had been about
      him during these days fell from him, and he regained his clear vision&mdash;he
      began to write as he always did:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...I didn't write last week, because I had so much to do. I
      really didn't have time, and you know how busy we get during these
      days with the examinations coming on and everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very well, except that I have these headaches&mdash;nothing
      at all, and I'm taking these liver pills that you told me of. I hope
      you 're all right, and that Dr. Sanders comes to see you every week.
      Keeping warm's the thing, old lady, with this weather, and that
      shawl that Miss Bennett gave you is the very thing&mdash;mind you wear it,
      and don't sit in draughts. I'm all right...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the pen dropped from his fingers, and his head fell between his
      hands. He wanted to tell her about Miss Desart, that she needn't be
      afraid now of his marrying anyone, that he was never going to marry....
      His mind was very clear now. It was like a moor when the mists have lifted
      away from it.... His unhappiness came all about him and held him to the
      ground. He did not hate Traill&mdash;Traill could not help it; but he
      wanted her&mdash;oh! he wanted her so dreadfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped on to his knees on the ground, and he was terribly troubled so
      that his back shook. He began with desperation, as though it were his last
      hold on life, to pray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! God, God, God!... Help me!... Do not let me go back again to
      that state that I have just been in. I cannot hold myself when I am like
      that. I do not know what I am doing or thinking. But it is all so hard&mdash;there
      are so many little things&mdash;there is no time!... They will not let me
      alone. Oh, God! give me my chance, give me my chance! Give me someone to
      love; I am so terribly alone... nobody wants me. Oh, God! do not let me go
      back to that darkness again.... I am so afraid of what I may do...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last exhaustion took him, there on the floor, and he slept with his
      head on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he awoke in the middle of the night and found himself there&mdash;and
      it was all very dark. He rose to his feet and was terribly frightened,
      because there, a gray figure against the fireplace, was the other Mr.
      Perrin&mdash;and he knew that God had not answered his prayer, and he
      cursed God and stumbled to his bed.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      And after that, things, for him, developed in an amazing way. He was quite
      sure now that God hated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he was sure of that, he need not care so much about keeping that
      box closed&mdash;he was damned anyhow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill now took complete possession of his mind. He never thought of
      anyone else, and it was exactly as though an iron weight was pressing on
      his head, shutting him down. He must get rid of that iron weight, because
      it was so disagreeable and prevented him thinking; but he was sure that it
      would not go until he had got rid of Traill: therefore Traill must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know how Traill would be likely to go, but he began to consider
      it....
    </p>
    <p>
      These days before the examinations began were very difficult for
      everybody, and Perrin began that hideous &ldquo;getting behind-hand&rdquo;
      that made things accumulate so that there seemed no chance of ever
      catching up. There were all the term's marks to be added up before
      the examinations began, there were trial papers and test questions to be
      set, and therefore a great many papers to be corrected. He found that he
      was not able to keep at it for very long at a time, but would sit in his
      chair with his hands folded in front of him and think of&mdash;Traill&mdash;and
      then he would find that the papers were not corrected and that there were
      others to be done, and they would be in dingy piles about his room&mdash;sometimes
      a pile would slip from the table on to the floor and would lie there
      scattered, and he would feel his rage rising so that if he had not, with
      all his force, kept it down he would have rushed screaming about his room.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with the whole staff this irritation was at work, and Perrin welcomed
      it because it amused him, and because it seemed to him in tune with his
      own moods. Always this week before the examinations was a very difficult
      one, but now, this term, it was worse than it had ever been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was badly understaffed, and always at this time the work was
      multiplied so that any spare hours that there had been before were now
      filled to overflowing. Also the examination scheme had now appeared and,
      whether by design or not, Moy-Thompson always arranged it so that one or
      two men seemed to have scarcely any work at all, and the others naturally
      had a great deal more than they could do. The quarrels that had broken out
      over the umbrella incident had developed until there was very little to
      prevent physical struggle. It happened that on this occasion, West was the
      person who was let off easily by the examination list, and he was not the
      kind of man to allow his advantage to pass without comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin passed a considerable amount of time now in the Senior common room.
      He never talked to anyone, but would sit in a dark corner by the window
      and watch them all. The funniest thoughts came to him as he sat there: for
      instance, he fancied that it would be pleasant, when they were not
      watching, to crawl under the table and bite White's legs&mdash;it
      would be amusing to spring suddenly from behind on to Comber's back,
      and to strip all the clothes from him until he was stark naked, and must
      run, screaming, from the room&mdash;or to twist Birk-land's ears
      round and round until they were tom and hung.... All these things would be
      pleasant to do, but he sat in his corner and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the day before the examinations arrived, and they were nearly all
      gathered in the Senior common room in the half-hour before Chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin, with his white face and untidy hair, watched them from his corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be very pleasant,&rdquo; West said, smiling a little,
      &ldquo;to have that third hour off all through this week. I can't
      think, Comber, why Moy-Thompson's given you all that extra Latin to
      do&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake,&rdquo; Comber broke out furiously, &ldquo;stop
      it! Aren't we all sick to death with hearing of your beastly good
      luck? Don't we all know that the whole thing's about as unfair
      as it is possible for anything to be? Just keep quiet about it if you can.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, of course, Comber,&rdquo; said West. &ldquo;You grudge a man
      any bit of luck that he may have. It's just like you. I never knew
      anything more selfish. If you'd had an hour off yourself, you
      'd have let us know about it all right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, stop talking about it anyhow, West,&rdquo; said Dormer.
      &ldquo;Leave it alone. Can't you see that we 're all as tired
      out as we can be? We've had enough fighting this term to last us a
      century.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      With common consent they seemed to sink their private differences in a
      common thought of that strange, silent man sitting behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all drew closer together. The pale gas-light fell on their faces, and
      they were all white and tired, with heavy, dark marks under their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      With their dark gowns, their long white hands, their pale faces, their
      heavy eyes, they moved silently about the room and gathered at last in a
      cluster by the fire, and stood and sat silently without a word. Only
      Perrin, hidden in the shadow behind them, did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly Birkland, who was standing a little away from the rest with
      his back against the wall, spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Dormer. We've fought enough this term to
      fill a great many years. We 're a wretched enough crew.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused; but no one spoke, and no one moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder sometimes,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;how long we are going
      to stand it. Most of us have been here a great many years&mdash;most of us
      have had our hopes broken a great many years ago&mdash;most of us have
      lost our pluck&mdash;&rdquo; Perhaps he expected a vehement denial,
      because he paused; but no one spoke, and no one moved. &ldquo;This term
      has been worse than any other since I have been here. We have all been
      very near doing things as well as thinking them. I wonder if you others
      have ever thought, as I have thought sometimes, that we have no right to
      be here?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean,&rdquo; said Comber slowly, &ldquo;no right?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we were not always like this. We were not always fighting and
      cursing like beasts. We were not always without any decency or
      friendliness or kindliness. We did not always have a man over us who used
      us like slaves, because he knew that we were afraid to give him notice and
      go. I was a man myself once. I thought that I was going to do things&mdash;we
      all thought that we were going to do things. Look at the lot of us, now&mdash;&rdquo;
      He paused again, but there was still silence. &ldquo;They say to us&mdash;the
      people outside&mdash;that it is our own fault, that other men have made a
      fine thing of teaching, that there are fine schools where life is
      splendid, that we have the interests of the boys under us in our hands. I
      know that&mdash;we all know that there are splendid schools and splendid
      lives; but what is that to do with us?... Do you know the kind of man that
      we have got over us? Do they know that every time that we have tried to do
      decently, it has been crushed out of us by that devil? Not a minute is our
      own; even in the holidays we are pursued. Let others come and try and see
      what they will make of it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A little stir like a wind passed through the listeners, but no one spoke.
      Birkland was leaning forward; his eyes were on fire, his hands waving in
      the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is not too late&mdash;it is not too late, I tell you. Let us
      break from it, let us go for the governors in a body and tell them that
      unless they improve our conditions, unless they remove Moy-Thompson,
      unless they give us more freedom, we will leave&mdash;in a body. There is
      a chance if we can act together, and better, far better, that we break
      stones in the road, that we die free men than this... that this should go
      on.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was almost a shout. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;think
      of it! Think of our chance! We are not dead yet. There is time. Let us act
      together and break free!&mdash;free!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had caught them, he had held them. They saw with his eyes. They moved
      together. Cries broke from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 're right, Birkland; you 're right. We won't
      stand it. It's our last chance.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now! Let us go now!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go and face him!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Birkland held them all with his uplifted hand. &ldquo;Now or never!&rdquo;
      he cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the door opened. Into the midst of their noise there came the
      voice of the school-sergeant, cold, unmoved&mdash;the voice of a thousand
      years of authority: &ldquo;The headmaster would like to see Mr. White as
      soon as possible.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the test. They all realized it as they turned to White to see what
      he would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment he stood there, tall, gaunt, haggard, his eyes held by
      Birkland's, the fire dying from them. For a moment he seemed to
      hesitate, his lips moved as though he would speak&mdash;then, with a
      helpless gesture of his hand, he moved slowly, with hanging head, down the
      room, and passed out through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence, and then from his chair in the dark corner Perrin
      laughed.

      CHAPTER XII&mdash;MR. PERRIN WALKS IN SLEEP
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ITH examinations
      there comes a new element into the life of the term&mdash;it is an element
      of triumph in so far as it marks the approaching end of an impossible
      situation; it is, an element of despair in so far as it provides an
      overpowering number of answers, differing in the minutest particulars, to
      the same questions; and is even an element of romance, because it heralds
      the appearance of a final order in which boys will beat other boys,
      generally in a surprising and unforeseen manner. But whatever it means it
      also tightens to a higher pitch any situation that there may have been
      before, so that anything that seemed impossible now appears incredible;
      the days are like years, and the hours, filled with the empty scratching
      of pens and the rubbing of blotting-paper, stretch infinitely into the
      distance and hide release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their effect on everyone on the present occasion was to force
      extravagantly the longing that everything might soon be over, that the
      situation couldn't stand the kind of strain that was being put upon
      it unless the curtain were rung down as soon as possible. Everyone was
      hideously busy with long periods of doing nothing except the aforesaid
      attention to pens and blotting-paper. Mr. Moy-Thompson had, moreover,
      invented a little scheme which always provided, as far as he was
      concerned, the pleasantest and most happy results. This was a plan whereby
      every master set and corrected the papers of some other master's
      form and then wrote a report on them. Here obviously was a most admirable
      opportunity for the paying off of old scores, as a bad report always led,
      next term, to a miserable period of bullying and baiting, with the hapless
      master who had incurred it in the rôle of victim. Therefore, if, as was
      usually the case, your especial enemy was correcting the papers of your
      form and would write a report on them, unless something were done to
      appease him, you were, during the whole of the next term, delivered over
      mercilessly to the Rev. Moy-Thompson. You might perchance appease your
      enemy, or you might yourself be examining <i>his</i> form, in which case
      you had every opportunity of a pleasant retort. At any rate, this plan
      invariably inflamed any hostilities that might already be in existence and
      resulted in the provision of at least half a dozen victims for Mr.
      Moy-Thompson's games on a later occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      For once, however, these examinations came to Perrin as very vague and
      misty affairs. This was not usual with him. As a rule they pleased him,
      because he could hold over hoys who had been rude to him during the term
      the terror of being detained all the first day of the holidays&mdash;also
      he considered that he was ingenious in the invention of pleasant Algebraic
      conundrums and fascinating, derisive questions in Trigonometry that
      prevented any possible solution. The devising of these gave him, as a
      rule, pleasure and amusement, but this term he could not face them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set his papers, in an odd, abstracted way, with questions from earlier
      papers, and then he sat with his hands folded in front of him and waited.
      There was only one subject now in the whole world, and all these curious
      boys, these strange, visionary class-rooms, these appalling noises, and
      then these equally appalling silences, only diverted his attention and
      prevented his thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were always three of them now&mdash;himself, the other Mr. Perrin,
      and Traill&mdash;they always went about together. When he was taking an
      examination and was sitting at his desk, isolated, by the wall, the other
      Mr. Perrin, a gray, thin figure, was behind him, looking into the room,
      and Traill stood, as he always did now, just inside the door, but away
      from Mr. Perrin's eye, because when he turned round and looked at
      him he always slipped, in the cleverest way, out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin wondered that other people didn't notice that he was
      accompanied by these persons, but probably they were all too occupied with
      their own affairs. Of course Traill must be got rid of&mdash;one couldn't
      possibly have anyone whom one hated as much as that always with one.
      Sometimes it was curiously confused, because there were two Traills&mdash;a
      Traill who moved about and spoke to people (although never to Perrin), and
      the Traill who stood always by the door and never moved at all except to
      slip away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin was quite clear in his own mind now that he hated Traill very much
      indeed, but he could not be very definitely sure of any reasons. There had
      been something once about an umbrella, and there was something else about
      Miss Desart, and there was even something about Garden Minimus; but none
      of these things were fixed very resolutely in his mind, and his thoughts
      slipped about like goldfish in a pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite certain, however, that Traill must not be allowed to go on
      like this, because he was a nuisance, and Perrin would sit for long hours
      whilst he was superintending examinations thinking about this and what he
      could do.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were moments, even hours, when the consciousness of the two figures
      at his side and the weighty burden of his decision left him. He saw
      suddenly as clearly as he had ever seen, and he was frightened; it was
      like waking from an evil dream, and just when he was gazing hack at it,
      frightened, even terrified, it would come slipping about him again, and
      the world would once more grow dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he was frightened at these intervals, because he seemed to realize
      then how dismal and unhappy it all was, and also how dangerous it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, during one of these clear moments, he was standing, a melancholy
      figure, by the iron gate, looking down the Brown Hill road, and Garden
      Minimus passed him. Perrin stopped him, and then when he saw the boy's
      round face and shining eyes, a little frightened now, and the mouth
      quivering a little, he had nothing to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he said, &ldquo;Oh!&mdash;Ah!&mdash;Garden&mdash;I haven't
      seen much of you lately. How do the exams go?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin had an absurd impulse to take the boy by the arm and ask him to be
      kind to him. He was so dreadfully unhappy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Garden was very frightened; he choked a little in his throat, and his
      eyes moved frantically down the white road as though appealing for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! very well, sir, thank you, sir&mdash;I&mdash;I could n't
      do the geography this morning, sir.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. Garden gave frightened glances up and down the
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When do you go for&mdash;um, ah,&mdash;your holidays, Garden?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Garden looked up in Mr. Perrin's face, and suddenly, young though he
      was, felt that Mr. Perrin was, as he put it afterwards, &ldquo;awfully
      sick about something&mdash;not ratty, you know, but jolly near blubbing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, with his friends, noticed that Perrin was &ldquo;jolly odd&rdquo;
      during these days, but now this thought struck him to the extinction of
      every other feeling. He had a sudden desire to help&mdash;after all, Old
      Pompous had been beastly decent to him&mdash;and then there came an
      overwhelming sensation of shyness, as though his feminine relations had
      suddenly appeared and claimed him in the company of his contemporaries. He
      looked down, rubbed one boot against the other, and then suddenly, with a
      murmured word about &ldquo;having to meet some fellows&mdash;beastly late,&rdquo;
      was off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin watched him go and then turned slowly back towards the school
      buildings. The shadows were creeping about him again. He felt that the
      other Mr. Perrin was behind him. He walked stealthily, a little as a cat
      prowls....
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time he took great curiosity in Traill's bedroom. He had
      never been inside it&mdash;he knew only that plain brown door with marks
      near the bottom of it where the paint had been scratched.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he sat now in his room and thought about it. He sat in a chair by the
      windows and looked across the room at his own door, at the square black
      lock and the shining brass handle. It was of course very easy to turn, and
      then he would be inside. It would be interesting to be inside&mdash;he
      would know then where the bed was, and the washing-stand, and the
      chairs... it might be useful to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to his own door and opened it, and looked very cautiously down the
      passage; there was no one there&mdash;it was all very silent. The sun of
      the December afternoon flooded the cold passage, and from downstairs the
      shouts of some boys floated up.... There were no other sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked very softly down the passage, his head lowered, his hands behind
      his back. He stopped outside Traill's bedroom door and listened
      again&mdash;he was surprised to hear that his heart was beating very
      loudly indeed. He pushed the door open and looked inside. The bed was near
      the window&mdash;the sun flooded the room and shone on the silver
      hair-brushes and the china basin and jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very simple room, and the bed took up most of it; there was one
      photograph.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went very softly up to it and saw that it was a photograph of Miss
      Desart&mdash;Miss Desart, smiling, out of doors with the sun on her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent towards the photograph, over the china basin, and kissed it. Then
      he went out, closing the door softly behind him.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      And the week wore away, and Monday came round. Thursday was Speech-Day,
      and on Friday everybody went home; all marks and form lists had to be in
      the headmaster's room on Wednesday night before nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin, on Monday evening, was vaguely conscious that he had corrected no
      papers at all. They lay about his room now in stacks&mdash;none of them
      were corrected. Some masters posted results as they corrected the papers;
      other masters left all the results until the end. It was not considered
      strange that Perrin had posted no results.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he knew as he looked at these white sheets that he ought to have done
      something with them. He stood in the middle of the room with his hands to
      his head and wondered what he ought to have done. Why, of course, he ought
      to correct them&mdash;he ought to say what was good and what was bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up a large pile of them, and they almost slipped from his fingers
      because there were so many. He found that it was a paper on French
      Grammar. He looked at the slip with the questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I. Give the preterite (singular only) and past participle of <i>donner,
      recevoir, laisser, s'asseoir</i>...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! s'asseoir was a hard one&mdash;he had always found that that was
      difficult. He turned over the page:
    </p>
    <p>
      J'eu, tu eus, il eut&mdash;that looked wrong.. .
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, here was Simpson Minor&mdash;&ldquo;Je fus, tu fus, il fut&rdquo;&mdash;surely
      that was confused in some way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers at the bottom slipped: he bent to prevent them falling, and all
      of them tipped over. They rose in a cloud about him, a white cloud, flying
      into the air, sailing to the other end of the room, diving under the table
      and into the fireplace, and a great white pile lay-scattered wildly on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silly papers stared at him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Je dors tous...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Il faut que...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I used to love my mother, but now I love my aunt...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rule for the conjunctive and disjunctive pronouns...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, Simpson Minor: &ldquo;Je fus, tu fus...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He was infuriated with their silly, stupid faces. They lay there on the
      floor, staring up at him and making no attempt whatever to move. He was
      maddened by their impassivity. He began to stamp on them, and then to
      trample on them&mdash;he rushed about the room, uttering little cries and
      wildly stamping... .
    </p>
    <p>
      And then something suddenly seemed to go in his brain, and he stopped
      still. What was he doing? He bent feebly to pick them up, but he could not
      collect them. He sat down at his table with his head in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave up trying to correct them. After all, they were not the
      important thing&mdash;the important thing was between himself and Traill;
      that was what he must think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Monday, and on Friday everyone would go away. He would go away,
      he supposed, with the rest: of course he would go to his mother. Traill
      would go away with Miss Desart... would he?
    </p>
    <p>
      The other Mr. Perrin leant over and whispered in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from this moment that Mr. Perrin came to the definite decision that
      something must be done before Friday. He made five black marks with a
      pencil on the yellow wallpaper in his bedroom, and he would lie hack on
      his bed at night, staring up at the marks whilst his candle guttered on
      the chair at his side. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...
      Monday passed, and he scratched another mark across the mark that he had
      already made. Tuesday passed, and that he also scratched out. Wednesday
      morning came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Divinity was the only examination left except Repetition on Thursday
      morning: Wednesday afternoon was a half-holiday.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave out the Old Testament questions:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1. Say what you know about the rebellion of Korah, Dathan, and
      Abiram; its cause and effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;2. Write briefly a life of Aaron...&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He found that now suddenly his brain was perfectly clear. To-day was
      Wednesday&mdash;before Friday he would kill Traill. The determination came
      to him perfectly plainly in the midst of these questions:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;6. Give context of: 'Kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I
      have found favor in thy sight.' &ldquo;'Let us make a captain
      and let us return into Egypt.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Is the Lord's hand waxed short?'.rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He would kill Traill. He did not mind at all what happened to him
      afterwards. What did it matter? Perhaps he would kill himself. He was a
      complete failure; he had never been any use at all, and had only been
      there for people to laugh at and mock him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it had not been for Traill he might have been of use&mdash;he might
      have married Miss Desart. Traill had been against him in every way, and
      now the only thing that was left for him to do was to kill Traill. He
      hated Traill&mdash;of course he hated Traill; but it was not really
      because of that that he was going to kill Traill&mdash;it was only because
      he wanted to show all these people that he could do something: he was not
      useless, after all. They might laugh at him and call him Pompous, but,
      after all, the laugh would be on his side at the end.... Traill would not
      be able to kiss Miss Desart very much longer&mdash;another day, and he
      would never be able to kiss her again.... That was a pleasant thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that he had decided this question he felt a great deal happier and
      easier in his mind. There was no longer any self-pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had given God His opportunity&mdash;he had prayed to God and besought
      Him; he had tried very hard at the beginning of this term to go right and
      to be agreeable to people and to keep the other Mr. Perrin in the
      distance, but everything had been very hard, and that was God's
      fault for making it so hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought that he would surprise God by killing Traill. God would not be
      expecting that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still more would he surprise the place&mdash;Moffatt's&mdash;that
      place that had treated him so cruelly all these years. It would be a
      grand, big thing to kill his enemy!
    </p>
    <p>
      On that Wednesday, half an hour before the midday dinner, he walked
      slowly, with his hands behind his bent back, through the long dining-hall.
      The long, black tables were laid for dinner, and beside every round,
      shining plate there lay two knives. These knives made a long, glittering
      line right down the table, and the sun caught their gleaming steel and
      flashed from knife to knife. The sight of them fascinated Mr. Perrin&mdash;it
      was with a knife that he would kill Traill&mdash;he would cut Traill's
      throat. He picked them up, one after the other, and felt their edges&mdash;they
      were all wonderfully sharp. There were a great many of them&mdash;you
      could cut a great many throats with all those knives, but he did not want
      to cut anyone else's throat except Traill's&mdash;Traill was
      his enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner that day he was pleasant and cheerful. He joked with the boys on
      either side of him and asked where they were going for the holidays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Cromer&mdash;um&mdash;yes, very pleasant. Our little friend
      will amuse himself hugely at Cromer, no doubt. Sure to over-eat on
      Christmas Day. Um, yes&mdash;and you, Larkin, where do you go?... Ah!
      Whitby&mdash;long way. Yes, able to read your holiday task in the train.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He sent the servant out to sharpen the carving-knife, and when it was
      brought back he attacked the mutton in the most furious way, scattering
      the gravy over the cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner he stood above the playing-fields, watching the clouds sail
      across the sky. It was a very gray-colored day, but there was the light of
      the sun behind it, so that everything shone without color but with a
      transparency as though one should be able to see other lights and colors
      behind it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin thought that he had never seen the clouds assume such curious
      shapes&mdash;perhaps they were not clouds at all, but rather creatures of
      the sky that only his eye could see, just as it was only his eye that
      could see the other Mr. Perrin. There were birds with long, bending necks,
      and fat, round-faced animals with only one eye, and stiff, angular
      creatures with wings and legs like sticks, and then again there were
      splendid galleons with sails unfurled, and cathedral towers and trees and
      mountain ranges&mdash;they were all very strange and beautiful, and
      perhaps this was the last time that he would see them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw, passing down the path to the right and walking fast in the
      direction of the road, two figures; another glance, and he saw that they
      were Miss Desart and Traill&mdash;there was no doubt at all that that was
      Miss Desart in her gray dress, and that man with his swinging stick was
      Traill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight of them together suddenly roused him to fury; it would be
      amusing to kill Traill now, there, before Miss Desart. He did not know how
      he would do it, perhaps he would spring on to Traill's back from
      behind and strangle him with his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, with the other Mr. Perrin at his ear, he followed them down the
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a day of ghosts&mdash;even the brown color of the earth of the hill
      that so seldom left it was gone to-day. It was not a cold day, and one
      felt that the sun was burning with intense heat in some neighboring place,
      but gray wisps of mist crept in and out of the black, naked hedges, and,
      at the bottom of the hill, banks of mist lay, visiting the cottages of the
      village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two figures passed in front of him down the hill and became, like the
      rest of the day, gray and misty, and he followed them, stealthily, with
      his hands behind his back. Their heads were very close together, and he
      could see that they were talking very eagerly. They were discussing,
      probably, their plans for the holidays, and it pleased him to think that
      he would make all their plans of no avail. It pleased the other Mr. Perrin
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed down the village street and then up the steep, narrow path to
      the road that led along the top of the cliffs. At the top of the path the
      mists had cleared again, and the rocks, hidden at the floor of the sea by
      gray vapor, stood as it were in mid-air, their black edges piercing the
      sky. When Mr. Perrin climbed to the top of the path, the other figures had
      preceded him some way along it and were almost hidden by boulders. He
      hastened a little so that he might keep them in sight, and then he hung
      back a little lest he should be too close to them. They were still talking
      very eagerly and crossed down a stony path that led to a sheltered cove.
      At the bottom of this they sat down on the sand, and Perrin hid behind a
      rock and watched them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world was terribly still, because, although there was a wind that made
      the clouds race along, it seemed to leave the sea alone, and the water
      made the very faintest sound as it touched the beach and faded away into
      the mist again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin found that his legs were very tired, and so he sat down behind
      his stone and peered out at them. They sat very close together on the
      sand, and then Traill put out his arm and Miss Desart crept into it and
      sat there with her head against his shoulder. And when Perrin saw that, he
      knew that he never could do anything to Traill whilst Miss Desart was
      there. A dreadful feeling of home-sickness came over him, and his eyes
      filled with tears. It was so unfair, so unfair. If only there had been
      someone there to whom he could have done that: if only there had ever been
      anyone in his life!... but he dashed the tears from his eyes. He had not
      come there to cry&mdash;he had come there for vengeance, and then, at that
      thought, he wondered whether after all he were not so poor a creature that
      he would never be able to kill anyone. Supposing he were to miss even this
      chance of achievement! There, behind his rock, he tried to gather together
      all his reasons for hating Traill; but he couldn't think properly,
      and the pebbles on which he was sitting were pressing into his trousers,
      and his neck was hurting because he craned it so.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate he was very uncomfortable, and as he could certainly do
      nothing whilst Miss Desart was there, he had better go away. And so he got
      up very slowly and painfully from behind his rock and went timidly up the
      path again.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      And that night, after going the round of the dormitories for the last
      time, he went into his room and closed his door with the clear
      determination of settling things up.
    </p>
    <p>
      His head had not been so clear for weeks. He saw at once that he had
      corrected no papers and that something must be done about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and, with the term's marks beside him, made out
      imaginary examination lists. Of course it was all very wrong, but it was
      for the last time, and he had, after all, put the boys in the order in
      which they would probably; occur. This took him about an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took all the files of examination papers and tore them up. This
      took a long time, and they filled, at last, his waste-paper basket to
      overflowing. Then he sat down to write to his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Dear Old Lady:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>This is the last time that you will see or hear from me. Do not regret
      it or anything that I have done, because I am no good, and am just a
      failure. There is £100 in the bank which I have saved, and you will get
      things with it. Sell my things: they will bring a little. I love you very
      much, old lady, but I am no good.&mdash;Your loving son,</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Vincent Perrin.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      He fastened up the letter and addressed it to&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Perrin,
    </p>
    <p>
      Holly Cottage,
    </p>
    <p>
      Bubblewick,
    </p>
    <p>
      Bucks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as he finished it he heard eleven o'clock strike. He waited
      until the clocks had ended, then he opened his door and looked down the
      passage. It was quite silent. He walked quietly down the stairs, down the
      lower passage, and so to the dining-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the long tables were laid for breakfast. He paused at one of the
      tables and chose one of the knives; they did not seem very sharp, and he
      tried others on the hack of his hand. At last he had selected one and put
      it under his coat. He returned to his room and closed his door. When he
      got there he stood in the middle of his room, and looked stupidly at the
      knife. What had he got it for? There was Traill next door... of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he could not do anything now. He had fancied that when one had got the
      knife, then the next thing was to go straight and do something with it.
      But he found that he could not, that he could not move from where he was,
      and that his hand was shaking as though with an ague.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knife dropped on to the floor with a sharp sound, and he sank into a
      chair. What a wretched, miserable creature he was, after all! There was
      nothing fine about him&mdash;there was nothing fine about anyone at
      Moffatt's&mdash;they were all a miserable lot... and to-morrow there
      would be speeches and prizes and cheering! What a funny thing life was!
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was no use thinking about life with that knife on the floor. It was
      quite clear that he wasn't going to do anything to-night&mdash;he
      might just as well go to bed. His headache was dreadfully bad, and he was
      shivering all over. He put the knife into a drawer and blew out his lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hated the dark&mdash;he had always hated it&mdash;and so he hurried
      into his bedroom and tried to light his candle, but his hand was shaking
      so that it was a long time before he could strike a match, and he cursed
      the matches feebly and felt inclined to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a long time undressing and sat on the edge of the bed in his shirt
      and looked at his long, thin legs and hated them; then he saw the black
      marks on the yellow paper, and he scratched another off.... At last he
      blew out the candle and got into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to fall asleep all at once and was aware that he was asleep&mdash;but
      after a time he felt that although he was asleep, he was conscious of
      someone watching him. He opened his eyes and saw that the other Mr. Perrin
      was sitting by his bed, watching him, and although the room was quite
      dark, the gray figure was in some way luminous, so that he could see that
      he wore a long, gray cloak and that his features were exactly the same as
      his own. He was forced against his will to get out of bed and to follow
      the other Mr. Perrin out of the house, down the long, white road, down to
      the sea. Here they were in that little cove where Traill and Miss Desart
      had been that afternoon. They sat with their backs against the rocks, and
      in all the air there was a strange, uncertain light, and the sea came over
      the shore in sullen, dreamy movements, as a tired woman's fingers
      move when she is sewing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. Perrin saw that down the beach there passed a long procession of
      gray, bending figures with heavy burdens on their backs. Their faces were
      white and hopeless, and their hands, with long, white fingers, hung at
      their sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of some great feeling of injustice&mdash;that this must
      not be allowed&mdash;and an over-mastering impulse to call out that it was
      all wrong and to run forward and relieve them of their burdens&mdash;but
      he could not move nor utter any sound. Then suddenly he recognized faces
      that he knew, and he saw White and Birkland and Combers and Dormer and
      then&mdash;his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a great cry and broke from his companion and rushed swiftly back
      up the white road, in through the black gates, up the stairs, and into his
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood in the middle of his room and felt suddenly cold. To his surprise
      he saw that the moon was shining through the window, although there had
      been no moon on the beach. The room was so bright that he could
      distinguish every object perfectly&mdash;and then he realized slowly that
      things were different. Those silver-backed hair-brushes were not his, his
      bed was not there&mdash;that photograph....
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone was in the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant his heart stopped beating. There was a draught between the
      window and the door... someone else was in the bed; he had been walking in
      his sleep; he was in Traill's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could see Traill quite clearly now, lying with one hand on the
      counterpane, his head on an arm. He was fast asleep, and his month was
      smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin shook from head to foot. Here was his opportunity&mdash;here
      was his enemy fast asleep... now. He stepped nearer to the bed&mdash;he
      bent over the face. Traill's pyjama-jacket was open at the neck...
      it would be very easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly, with a little cry and his face in his hands, he crept from
      the room.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next day, its
      brilliant sun and hard, shining cold, brought in its train great things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last day of the Christmas term was in some ways greater than the last
      day of the summer term, because it was a more private family affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      One addressed one's ancestors, one arrayed one's traditions,
      one fashioned one's history, with flags and flowers and orations,
      but it was in the midst of the family that it was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Parents&mdash;mothers and fathers and cousins&mdash;were indeed there, but
      they, too, must recognize that it was not for their immediate individual
      Johnny or Charles that these things were done, but rather for the great
      worship and recognition of Sir Marmaduke Boniface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Marmaduke Boniface has hitherto received no mention in this slender
      history, but his importance in any chronicle of Moffatt's cannot be
      over-estimated. He was a Cornish; magnate, living and dying some hundred
      years ago, growing rich in the pursuit of jam, building large stone
      mansions out of that same delicacy, fat, pompous, and fading at last into
      a heavy stone monument in the corner of the church at the bottom of the
      Brown Hill&mdash;a great man in his day and in his place, amongst other
      things the founder of Moffatt's.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not very long ago; outside the confines of Cornwall he had been
      perhaps but vaguely recognized&mdash;perchance, perchance, the surest
      foundation of an extravagant record.... No matter, here we have our
      tradition, and let us make the best possible use of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this Marmadukery&mdash;a hideous word, but it serves&mdash;spread far
      beyond that stout originator. It was the spirit of the public school, the
      <i>esprit de corps</i> signified by the School song (it began &ldquo;Procul
      in Cornubia,&rdquo; and was violently shouted at stated intervals during
      the year), the splendid appeal &ldquo;to our fathers who have played in
      these fields before us&rdquo;&mdash;this was the cry that these banners
      and orations signified. Moffatt's was not a very old school, true&mdash;but
      shout enough about some founder or other and the smallest boy will have
      tears in his eyes and a proud swelling at his breast. Sir Marmaduke
      becomes medieval, mystic, &ldquo;the great, good man&rdquo; of history,
      and Moffatt's is &ldquo;one of our good old schools. There's
      nothing like our public school system, you know&mdash;has its faults, of
      course; but tradition&mdash;that 's the Thing.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The stout figure of Sir Marmaduke hangs heavy over the day. Everyone feels
      it&mdash;everyone feels a great many other things as well, but Sir
      Marmaduke is the Thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the Thing in some vague, blind way even to Mrs. Comber, so that he
      kept coming into the confused but happy conversation to which she treated
      anxious parents on the morning of this great day. Mothers arrived in great
      numbers on these occasions, and these three great days of the three terms
      were to Mrs. Comber the happiest and most confused events in the year.
      They marked an approaching freedom, they marked the immediate return of
      her own children, and they marked an amazing number of things that ought
      to be done at once, with the confusing feeling about Sir Marmaduke also in
      the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-day she was happy; this horrible, terrible term was almost over.
      She had been so sure that something dreadful was going to happen, and
      nothing dreadful had happened, after all. They were safe&mdash;or almost
      safe&mdash;and her dear Isabel and Isabel's young man would be out
      of the place before they knew where they were. Then her own Freddie had
      last night, suddenly, before going to bed, taken her in his arms and
      kissed her as he had never kissed her before. Oh! things were going to be
      all right... they were escaping for a time at any rate. In the thought of
      the holidays, of a month's freedom, everything that had happened
      during the term was swiftly becoming faint and vague and distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she was smiling in her sitting-room with four mothers about her, one
      very fat and one very thin, one in blue and one in gray, and they all sat
      very stiff in their chairs and listened to what she had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a great deal to say, because she was feeling so happy, and
      happiness always provoked volubility, but she made the mistake of talking
      to all four of them at once, and they, in vain, like anglers at a pool,
      flung, desperately, hurried little sentences at her, but secured no
      attention. Beyond and above it all was the shadow of Sir Marmaduke.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her happiness, when she drove them at length from her, caught at the
      advancing figure of Isabel, with a cry and a clasp of the hand: &ldquo;My
      dear!&mdash;no, we 've only got a minute, because lunch is early&mdash;one
      o'clock, and cold&mdash;you don't mind, do you, dear; but
      there's to be <i>such</i> a dinner to-night, and I've just had
      four mothers, and wise is n't the word for what I've been,
      although I confused all their children as I always do, bless their hearts.
      But, oh! the term's over, and I could go on my knees and thank
      Heaven that it is, because I 've never hated anything so much, and
      if it had lasted another week I should have struck off Mrs. Dormer's
      head for the way she's treating you, for dead sure certain&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Archie's not coming back, you know,&rdquo; Isabel
      interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, I knew. He went and saw Moy-Thompson last week, and of
      course it's the wisest thing, and I only wish my Freddie was as
      young and we'd be off from here tomorrow.&rdquo; She stopped and
      sighed a little and looked through the window at the hard, shining ground,
      the stiff, bare trees, the sharp outline of the buildings. &ldquo;But it's
      no use wishing,&rdquo; she went on cheerfully enough, &ldquo;and we won't
      any of us think of next term at all but only of the blessed month of
      freedom that's in front of us.&rdquo; Her voice softened; she put
      her hand on Isabel's arm. &ldquo;All the same, my dear, I'm
      glad you and Archie are getting away from it all. It was touching him, you
      know.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I saw it,&rdquo; the girl answered. &ldquo;And I don't
      want him to schoolmaster again if he can help it. I think with father's
      help he 'll be able to get a Government office of some sort.&rdquo;
      She hesitated, then said, smiling a little, &ldquo;Are you and Mr. Comber&mdash;&rdquo;
      She stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Comber bruskily, &ldquo;we are&mdash;and
      there 's no doubt that things are better than they have been. I
      suppose marriage is always like that: there 's the thrilling time at
      first, and then you find it is n't there any longer and you've
      got to make up your mind to getting along. Things rub you up, you know,
      and I'm sure I 've been as tiresome as anything, and then
      there's a good big row and the air's cleared&mdash;and shall I
      wear that big yellow hat or the black one this afternoon?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The black one fits the day better,&rdquo; said Isabel
      absent-mindedly. She was wondering whether the time would ever come when
      she and Archie would feel ordinary about each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But isn't it funny,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that here we
      are at the end of the term, and already, with the holiday beginning, all
      our quarrels and fights about things like that silly umbrella are seeming
      impossible? It was all too absurd, and yet I was as angry as anyone.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all comes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Comber, &ldquo;of our living too
      close. Now that we're going to spread out over the holidays, we
      're as friendly as anything, although really, my dear, I hate Mrs.
      Dormer as much as ever&rdquo;&mdash;which was difficult to believe when
      that lady arrived at a quarter-past two to pick up Mrs. Comber and Isabel
      and to go with them to the prize-giving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her dress was obviously very stiff and difficult, with a high, black neck
      to it, with little ridges of whalebone all around it, and out of this she
      spoke and smiled. The two ladies were very pleasant to one another as they
      walked down the path to the school hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where are you going for your Christmas vacation, Mrs. Comber?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't know. It depends so much on the boys and the
      housemaid. I mean the housemaid's given notice, you know, because I
      had to speak to her about breathing when handing round the vegetables; and
      she gave notice on the spot, as they all do when I speak to them, and
      unless I can get another, I really don't think I shall ever be able
      to get away.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, what servants are coming to!&rdquo; Mrs. Dormer was
      struggling with her collar like a dog. &ldquo;Poor Mrs. Comber, I am <i>so</i>
      sorry&mdash;of course management's the thing, but we haven't
      all the gift and can't expect to have it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Mrs. Dormer, I do hope that you are going to be here over
      Christmas, so that we can keep each other company. It would be <i>so</i>
      nice if you and Mr. Dormer would come to us on Boxing evening, even if I
      have n't got a housemaid, and I heard of a very likely one from Mrs.
      Rose yesterday&mdash;quite a nice girl she sounded&mdash;who's been
      under-parlormaid at Colonel Forster's now for the last five years,
      and never a fault to find with her except a tendency to catching cold,
      which made her sniff at times.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, dear Mrs. Comber; but my husband and I are hoping to
      spend a few days in London about that time. Otherwise we should have loved&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      For so much charity is the presence of Sir Marmaduke Boniface responsible.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sir Marmaduke, and all that his coming signified, was also responsible for
      clearing the air in other directions. Young Traill found, on this morning,
      that people were very much pleasanter to him than they had hitherto been.
      The coming holidays were obviously to be a truce, and, as he was not
      returning next term, it was an end of things so far as he was concerned.
      He could not feel proud of it all. The events of the term had shown him
      that he was not nearly so fine a fellow as he had thought himself. His
      pride, his temper, his irritation&mdash;all these things were lions with
      which he had never fought before: now they must always, for the future, be
      consciously kept in check.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was tired, exhausted, worn-out. He was very glad that he was going away&mdash;now
      he would be able to have Isabel to himself, and they might, together,
      forget this horrible nightmare of a term. He looked on the buildings of
      Moffatt's as the iron prison of some hideous dream. He could not
      sleep for the thought of it. Last night he had had some bad dream... he
      could not remember now what it had been, but he had wakened suddenly in a
      great panic, to imagine that someone was closing his door. Of course it
      had only been the wind, but he hoped that he would sleep properly
      to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate he was glad that people were going to be pleasant to him on
      this last day of the term. The stout Miss Madder, Dormer, Clinton&mdash;they
      all seemed to be sorry that he was going, in spite of all the trouble that
      he had made. He did not think of Perrin....
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he suddenly remembered Birkland. He would go and say good-by to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He climbed the steep stairs and found the little man busily packing. The
      floor was covered with packing cases, books lay about in piles, and the
      air was full of dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Traill, coughing in the doorway, &ldquo;what's
      all this?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Birkland, looking up. &ldquo;I'm glad you
      've come. I was coming round to see you, if you hadn't. I'm
      off for good.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off for good!&rdquo; Traill stared in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for good or bad. The things that have happened this term have
      finally screwed me up to a last attempt. One more struggle before I die&mdash;nothing
      can be worse than this&mdash;I gave notice last week.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; asked Traill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;it's mad enough, I expect. But I've
      saved a tiny hit of money that will keep me for a time. I shall have a
      shot at anything. Nothing can he as bad as this&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, looking grim and scant enough in his shirt-sleeves with dust
      on his cheeks and his hair on end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm damned!&rdquo; said Traill. &ldquo;Well, after all,
      I'm on the same game. I don't know what I'm going to do
      either. We 're both in the same box.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Birkland, &ldquo;you've got youth and a
      beautiful lady to help you. I'm alone, and most of the spirit's
      knocked out of me after twenty years of this; but I'm going to have
      a shot&mdash;so wish me luck!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course I do,&rdquo; said Traill, coming up to him. &ldquo;We
      'll do it together&mdash;we 'll see heaps of each other.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! heaps!&rdquo; said Birkland, shaking his head. &ldquo;No, I'm
      too dry and dusty a stick by this time for young fellows like you. No, I'm
      better alone. But I 'll come and see you one day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite right,&rdquo; said Traill suddenly, &ldquo;in what
      you said about the place the evening at the beginning of the term when I
      came in to see you. You were quite right.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor boy,&rdquo; said Birkland, looking at him affectionately,
      &ldquo;you had a hard dose of it. Perhaps it was all for the best, really.
      It drove you out. If I'd been treated to that kind of row at the
      beginning, I mightn't have been here twenty years. And, after all,
      you met Miss Desart here.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Traill, &ldquo;that makes it worth it fifty times
      over.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; went on Birkland grimly, &ldquo;this afternoon you
      shall see the closing scene of our pageant. You shall see our glory, our
      tradition. You will hear the head of our body state his satisfaction with
      the term's work, proclaim his delight at the friendly spirit that
      pervades the school, allude, through the great Sir Marmaduke Boniface,
      maker of strawberry jam, to our ancient and honorable tradition in which
      we all, from the eldest to the youngest, have our humble share.&rdquo; He
      spread his arms. &ldquo;Oh! the mockery of it! To get out of it!&mdash;to
      get out of it! And now, at last, after twenty years, I'm going. If
      it hadn't been for you, Traill, I believe I'd be here still.
      Well, perhaps it's to breaking stones on a road that I'm
      going... at any rate, it won't be this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And so here, too, Sir Marmaduke Boniface is remembered and has his
      influence.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      But with all these fine spirits, with all this stir and friendly feeling,
      with all this preparation for a great event, Mr. Perrin had little to do.
      This morning had, in no way, been for him a reconciling or a triumph at
      approaching freedom. After some three or four hours' troubled and
      confused sleep he awoke to the humiliating, maddening consciousness that
      he had again, now for the second time, missed his chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This one thing that he had thought he could do he had missed once more;
      not even at this last, blind vengeance was he any good.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-morrow it would be too late; Traill, his enemy, would be gone, they
      would all be gone, and he would return, next term, the same insignificant
      creature at whom they had all laughed for so long; and then it would be
      worse than ever, because Traill would have escaped him, and in the distant
      ages it would be told how once there had been a young man, straight from
      the University, who had flung him to the ground and trampled on him, and
      beaten him, in all probability, with his own umbrella....
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah, no! it was not to be borne&mdash;the thing must be done; there must be
      no missing of an opportunity this third time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the Repetition that morning with a vacant mind. Somerset-Walpole
      knew nothing about it, but for once in his life he suffered no punishment.
      Perrin thought afterwards that Garden Minimus had looked at him as though
      he would like to speak to him, but he could not think of Garden Minimus
      now&mdash;there were other more important things to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it must be done that night&mdash;there was only one night left.
      Afterwards he thought that he would go down to the sea and drown himself.
      He had heard that drowning was rather pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mind was busy, all that morning, with the things that everyone would
      say afterwards. He wished very much that he could stay behind in some way
      that he might hear what they said. At any rate, they would be able to
      laugh at him no longer; he would appear to all of them as something
      terrible, portentous, awful... that, at any rate, was a satisfaction. Miss
      Desart, of course, would be sorry. That was a pity, because he did not
      wish to hurt Miss Desart; but, in the end, it would be all for the best,
      because she was much too good for a man like Traill and would only be
      unhappy if she married him.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a scene there would be when they found Traill in bed with his throat
      cut!&mdash;no, they would not laugh at him again!
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to nobody that morning; but, when Repetition was over, he went
      back to his room and sat there, quite still, in his chair, looking in
      front of him, with the door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Traill came up and spoke to him just as he was on his way up to
      the school for the speeches.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled and said, &ldquo;Oh! I say, Perrin, do let us make it all up&mdash;now
      that term is over, and I 'm not coming back. I do hate to think that
      we should not part friends&mdash;it's all been my stupid fault, and
      I am so very sorry.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Perrin did not stop, nor answer. He walked straight up the path with
      his eyes looking neither to the left nor the right. After all, you couldn't
      shake hands with a man whose throat you were going to cut in the evening.
      He heard Traill's exasperated &ldquo;Oh! very well,&rdquo; and then
      he passed into Big School.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stepped into the hall as unobtrusively as possible. The boys were
      always there first, and it was their way to cheer the masters as they came
      in. If you were very popular, they cheered you loudly; if you were
      unpopular, they cheered you not at all. Perrin had no illusions about his
      popularity, and the silence on his entrance did not therefore surprise
      him, but matters were not improved by the roar of cheering that greeted
      Traill. Ah, well! they would never cheer him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys were placed in rows down the room according to their forms, and
      the masters sat where they pleased. Perrin stationed himself in a corner
      by the wall at the back; he fastened his eyes on the platform and kept
      them there until the end of the ceremonies&mdash;no one noticed him&mdash;no
      one spoke to him&mdash;not for him were their songs and festivals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raised platform at the end of the hall was surrounded with flowers,
      and ranged against the wall, seated on hard, uncertain chairs were the
      Governing Body, or as many of the Governing Body as had spared time to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were for the most part large, serious, elderly gentlemen, with stout
      bodies, and shining, beady eyes; their immovability implied that they
      considered that the business would be sooner over were they passive and as
      nonexistent as possible&mdash;they all wore a considerable amount of
      watch-chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of them was a long, black table, and on this were ranged the
      prizes&mdash;a number of impossibly shiny volumes that might have been
      biscuit-tins, for all the reading that they seemed to contain. Beside them
      in a wooden armchair was seated a little man like a sparrow, in patent
      leather boots and a high, white collar, whose smile was intermittent, but
      regular.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was Sir Arthur Spalding, who had been asked to give away the prizes,
      because ten other gentlemen had been invited and refused. On the other
      side of the table the Rev. Moy-Thompson tried to express geniality and
      authority by the curves of his fingers and the bend of his head; he
      stroked his beard at intervals. In the front rows the ladies were seated:
      Mrs. Comber, large and smiling, in purple; Mrs. Moy-Thompson, endeavoring
      to escape her husband's eye, but drawn thither continually as though
      by a magnet; the Misses Madder, Mrs. Dormer, Isabel, and many parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proceedings opened with a speech from the Rev. Moy-Thompson. He
      alluded, of course, in the first place to Sir Marmaduke Boniface, &ldquo;our
      founder, hero, and example&rdquo;; then by delicate stages to Sir Arthur
      Spalding, whose patent leather boots simply shone with delight at the
      pleasant things that were said. This preface over, he dilated on the
      successes of the term. K. Somers had been made a Commissioner of Police in
      Orang-Mazu-Za (cheers); W. Binnors had been fifteenth in an examination
      that had something to do with Tropical Diseases (more cheers); M. Watson
      had received the College Essay Prize at St. Catherine's College,
      Cambridge; and C. Duffield had obtained a second class in the first part
      of the Previous Examination at the same university (frantic cheering,
      because Duffield had been last year's captain of the Rugby
      football.) All this, Mr. Moy-Thompson said, was exceedingly encouraging,
      and they could not help reflecting that Sir Marmaduke Boniface, were he
      conscious of these successes, would be extremely pleased (cheers). Passing
      on to the present term, he was delighted to be able to say that never, in
      all his long period as headmaster, could he remember a more equable and
      energetic term (cheers). As a term it had been marked perhaps by no events
      of special magnitude, but rather by the cordial friendliness of all those
      concerned. Masters and boys, they had all worked together with a will. It
      was a familiar saying that &ldquo;a nation was blessed that had no history&rdquo;&mdash;well,
      that applied to such a term as the one just concluded (cheers). If he
      might allude once more to their excellent Founder, he was quite sure that
      Sir Marmaduke Boniface was precisely the kind of man to rejoice in this
      spirit of friendship (cheers). He must here allude for a moment to his
      staff. Surely a headmaster had never been surrounded with so pleasant a
      body of men&mdash;men who understood exactly the kind of <i>esprit de
      corps</i> necessary if a school's work were to be properly carried
      on; men who put aside all private feelings for the one great purpose of
      making Moffatt's a great school&mdash;that was, he truly believed,
      the one aim and object of every man and boy in Moffatt's&mdash;they
      might be sure that was the one and only aim and object that he ever kept
      before him. He had nothing more to do but introduce Sir Arthur Spalding,
      who would give away the prizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Moy-Thompson sat down, hot and inspired, amidst a burst of frantic
      cheering and clapping, but was suddenly chilled by the consciousness of
      Mr. Perrin's eyes glaring at him in the strangest manner across the
      room. He shifted his chair a little to the left, so that a boy's
      head intervened. The Governing Body at the conclusion of his speech moved
      their heads to the right, then to the left, smiled once, and resumed their
      immovability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Arthur Spalding was nervous, but found courage to say that he believed
      in our public schools&mdash;that was the thing that made men of us&mdash;he
      should never forget what he himself owed to Harrow. He should like to say
      one thing to the boys&mdash;that they were not to think that winning
      prizes was everything. We couldn't all win prizes; let those who
      failed to obtain them remember that &ldquo;slow and steady wins the race.&rdquo;
      It wasn't always the boys who won prizes who got on best afterwards.
      No&mdash;um&mdash;ah&mdash;he never used to win prizes at school himself.
      It wasn't always the boys&mdash;here he pulled himself up and
      remembered that he had said it before. There was something else that he'd
      wanted to say, but he'd quite forgotten what it was. Here he was
      conscious of Mr. Perrin's eyes and thought that he'd never
      seen anything so discouraging. He did not seem to be able to escape them.
      What a dangerous-looking man!
    </p>
    <p>
      So he hurriedly concluded. Just one word he'd like to leave them
      from our great poet Tennyson&mdash;! He looked for the little piece of
      paper on which he had written the verse. He could not find it; he searched
      his pockets&mdash;no&mdash;where had he put it? Lady Spalding, in the
      third row, suffered horrible agonies. He recovered himself and was vague.
      He would advise them all to read Tennyson, a fine poet, a very fine poet&mdash;yes&mdash;and
      now he would give away the prizes.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mr. Perrin up to the commencement of Mr. Moy-Thompson's
      speech, had been merely conscious that a period of waiting had, so to
      speak, &ldquo;to be put in.&rdquo; He was not aware, in the very least,
      that his eyes were causing both Sir Arthur Spalding and Mr. Moy-Thompson
      acute discomfort; he was not aware that boys were looking at him, watching
      him with eager curiosity and nudging one another, speculatively. He was
      not aware that Isabel's eyes were upon him, eyes of pity &ldquo;because
      he looked so queer, as though he had a headache.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there, beside the small round-eyed boys of the First and Second
      Forms, staring in front of him, without moving. The first words of
      Moy-Thompson's speech fell upon his ears unconsciously. It did not
      matter what they said, it did not matter what they thought, the case at
      issue was between himself and Traill and he faced that with an irritated
      impatience at these tiresome hours that kept him from his eager
      realization.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began slowly to understand the things that Moy-Thompson was saying. And
      suddenly it was as though he had, morally and mentally, taken himself,
      forcibly, out of one room into another&mdash;out of a room in which there
      was only Traill's figure, gray, shadowy, by the door, otherwise
      dark, obscured by a clinging mist... a dangerous place... into a place
      that had for its furniture tangible things, things like this speech that
      Moy-Thompson was making, things that had to do with no especial figure,
      but rather with a vast, intolerable condition, with a system.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was he saying?... How dare he? Perrin moved impatiently in his place.
      He looked at the row of faces raised to the platform, the silly, stupid
      faces. <i>That</i> Mrs. Thompson in her thin black dress with her bony
      neck; <i>that</i> silly, cheerful Mrs. Comber in her bulging, flaming
      garments; <i>that</i> Lady Spalding, so stiff and sharp, as though she
      were of any importance to anyone&mdash;all of them listening to these
      things that Moy-Thompson was saying, and believing them, believing
      these... Lies!
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill was almost forgotten as Perrin stepped a little forward from the
      wall in order that he might hear better. The sight of Moy-Thompson's
      face up there on the platform smiling, so complacent, patriarchal with
      that white beard wagging at the end of it, brought the blood to his head.
      He clenched his thin hands. What were the other men doing that they could
      stand there and listen to these lies? Why did they not step forward and
      tell the truth to all those stupid women and those fat governors, to the
      little man with the shining boots on the platform? They knew that these
      thing were lies. Had not this term been hell, had it not been slow torture
      for them all, had not that man with the white beard full knowledge of
      these lies that he was telling? What was his private quarrel with Traill
      as compared with this monstrous injustice? He was pale now, with a long
      red mark against the white of his cheek. He had stepped right away from
      the wall and the small boys of the First and Second Forms were watching
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It came upon him suddenly, like a flash from the lightning of heaven, that
      it was for him to escape these things. He had suffered more than the
      others, he knew better than they the things that were done in this place!
      Something was going round in his head like a red-hot wire, but he
      remembered, even at that confused moment, that scene a few days before in
      the common room, when they had all been so nearly stirred to revolt by
      Birkland. What if he were to break the bonds?... What rot! what rot! what
      rot! He could have shouted it to the roof&mdash;&ldquo;Lies! Lies! Lies!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little stir and rustle as Moy-Thompson finished his speech&mdash;ladies'
      dresses moved against the chairs, boots slipped along the floor&mdash;and
      then a burst of cheering and clapping. Perrin rubbed his hands against one
      another&mdash;they were hot and dry and something rather like a bobbin on
      a latch went up and down in his throat&mdash;his eyes were burning. He
      moved a little further from the wall and a little nearer to the central
      gangway between the blocks of boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Sir Arthur Spalding stood nervously behind the glittering copies
      of &ldquo;Tennyson's Poems,&rdquo; Sir Robert Ball's &ldquo;Wonders
      of the Heavens,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Works of Spencer,&rdquo; and other
      volumes of our admirable classics. They began with the bottom of the
      school, and a small fat boy with a crimson face, boots that creaked like a
      badly-oiled door and were shaped like Chinese boats, staggered up to the
      platform. A lady, prominent for her size and large picture hat moved
      eagerly in her chair, clapped vehemently with her white gloves and so
      proclaimed herself a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Arthur Spalding had every intention of making a pleasant speech to
      each prizewinner&mdash;&ldquo;something that they could remember
      afterwards, you know&rdquo;&mdash;and began to say something to the small
      and red-faced boy, but was startled by the sound of eager, anticipatory
      breathing close to his ear. Turning round, he discovered that three more
      small boys were waiting anxiously for their turn and that others were
      coming up the room. He therefore hurried along with &ldquo;Here you are,
      my boy. Remember that prizes aren't everything in life&mdash;hope
      you 'll read it&mdash;delightful book.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin watched these boys passing up and down with eager eyes. He must
      wait&mdash;now was not the time, but soon there would be another speech to
      thank the absurd man with the boots for giving the prizes away. To his
      excited fancy it seemed to him now that the rest of the staff were looking
      at him as though they knew what he was going to do. They must have felt as
      indignant as he did at those lies that this man had been telling them. But
      those governors should know the truth for once at any rate and in a way
      that they should not forget... strangely, in the back of his mind he
      wished that his mother could be present....
    </p>
    <p>
      The senior boys were going up for their prizes now and were cheered
      according to their popularity. The Cricket captain, an enormous fellow,
      had secured something for Mathematics, and the room burst into a tempest
      of applause as he moved heavily up to the platform. He seemed very pleased
      with it all, Mr. Perrin thought, and received his prize with a flushed
      face and a friendly smile, and yet he had always been one of the leading
      rebels in the school. How easily these people were subdued, with a book
      and a few pleasant words&mdash;fool! Mr. Perrin's breath came
      quicker as he watched the boy stumble back to his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the prizes delivered, Mr. Moy-Thompson rose to say a few words. It
      had been very gratifying, he said, to all of them to have so distinguished
      a visitor as Sir Arthur Spalding amongst them that afternoon. It must have
      been difficult for Sir Arthur to have found time amongst so many
      engagements to come and spend an afternoon with them. (Cheers&mdash;Sir
      Arthur conveys a sense of hurry and confusion and looks at his shirt cuffs
      as though his engagements were written down there.) They on their part
      were greatly the gainers because there was no one in the room, however
      young, however inexperienced, who would not remember, as long as he lived,
      those words of encouragement and cheer. Indeed, it was not only for the
      winners of prizes that life was intended (here Mr. Moy-Thompson repeated
      many of Sir Arthur Spalding's remarks and the governors moved
      restlessly in their chairs), but (and here Mr. Moy-Thompson started on a
      new note) it might not be, perhaps, presumptuous of him to hope that it
      was not only for them that afternoon might have pleasant memories. For Sir
      Arthur Spalding also, he might hope, there would be times in the future
      when he would look back and remember that he had seen, for an instant at
      least, one of our British public schools in one of its happiest and most
      prosperous phases. He might flatter himself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It 's all lies!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice cut into the quiet and solemnity of the occasion like a knife.
      To the small hoys of the First and Second Forms, tired already of the
      over-long ceremony, their eyes wandering restlessly about the room, there
      may perhaps have been no surprise. They had watched that strange master of
      theirs&mdash;&ldquo;that old ass Pompous&rdquo;&mdash;seen his edging from
      the wall into the center of the room, seen his eyes burning, his hands
      clenching and unclenching, his lips moving. To them that sudden cry, that
      sudden lifting of a fist as though he would strike the patriarch to his
      feet, could have come with no uncalculated emotion. But to the rest, to
      the governors heavily somnolent, to Sir Arthur Spalding plaintively
      desiring his tea, to Mrs. Moy-Thompson, to Mrs. Comber, the matrons, the
      staff, the rest of the school, it came driving through the place like a
      wind, &ldquo;What? Who?...&rdquo; They rose in their places, they uttered
      little cries, they stood on the forms, but no one stopped that voice&mdash;they
      were held, paralyzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there were very few there who, in after days, forgot that strange
      figure, standing in the back of the room, the light of the high window
      upon him, his thin figure strung to its tensest, his hand raised, his
      gaunt cheeks white, his eyes on fire....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's lies, all lies!&rdquo; The words came tumbling out one
      upon another. &ldquo;I don't care&mdash;I must speak. Ladies and
      gentlemen,&rdquo;&mdash;he caught his throat for a moment with his hand&mdash;&ldquo;I
      know that this is no occasion for saying those things, but no one else has
      the courage&mdash;the courage. It is not true what he has been saying&rdquo;&mdash;he
      pointed a vehement, trembling finger at the white patriarch. &ldquo;We are
      unhappy here, all of us. We are downtrodden by that man&mdash;we are not
      paid enough&mdash;we are not considered at all&mdash;never considered&mdash;everything
      is wrong&mdash;we all hate each other&mdash;we hate <i>him</i>&mdash;he
      hates <i>us</i>&mdash;we are unhappy&mdash;it is all hell.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt that his voice was quivering. He knew that he was shaking from
      head to foot. He cried once more querulously, &ldquo;It is all hell
      here... hell!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, suddenly, with head hanging and his hands dropping hopelessly to
      his side, he turned and, amidst an intense silence, left the room by the
      wide doors behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There rose, like the murmur of the sea, from the body of the school:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It 's Perrin.&rdquo;
    </p>

      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;MR. PERRIN REACHES THE HEART OF HIS KINGDOM
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E was entirely
      unconscious of the world about him as he hurried across the green
      quadrangles to his rooms. He saw no sky, nor flying clouds, nor grass, nor
      gray buildings. He thought not at all of any effect that his words may
      have on the people that had heard them; he had no interest in what had
      happened after he had left the building. The one fact was there before
      him, that he, Perrin, the despised, the mocked, the rejected, had flung
      into the midst of them all his bomb. They might hate him now; the
      governors and the rest might expel him furiously; they might deny
      indignantly his accusations, but they could not, any longer, ignore him.
      His little room was strangely cool and gray and quiet. Everything in it
      watched him with as sedate and respectable an air as though nothing
      tremendous had happened, the hooks, the old chairs, the little specks of
      dust floating in the sunlight, and then suddenly something gleaming from
      beneath the pile of examination papers on the table. He turned the papers
      over, and there, shining against the old, worn-out tablecloth, was the
      knife. He stared at it and then very slowly and thoughtfully put it away
      in a drawer. He did not want it now. He was surprised, amazed, at the
      indifference with which he looked at it. That morning it had meant so
      much, now&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not Traill that he was going to kill; it was something larger,
      greater, more sweeping&mdash;a system, and at the head of the system, a
      tyrant.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up and down his room with his hands tightly clenched behind his
      back. As the minutes passed he grew cooler and more collected. What would
      they do? They could not pass over so public a defiance; there must be an
      enquiry, there would have to be witnesses. The curious illusions that had
      been with him during these last weeks&mdash;the illusions about the other
      Mr. Perrin, for instance, and that strange fancy about Traill being always
      in the room&mdash;had vanished suddenly. Things were as they most
      certainly appeared to be; that table, those chairs were most solidly
      there, and Mr. Perrin touched them with his hands and smiled at their
      solidity. Then also it was odd that those incidents that had seemed only
      that morning of such paramount importance were now insignificant. That
      quarrel over the umbrella, for instance&mdash;really, how absurd! When one
      was a rebel, a Prometheus, one of the Titans, why then this ignominious
      quarreling was a small affair. He pushed all the question of Traill aside
      with almost a contemptuous smile. There were bigger things now in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would they do? That was now the all-important question. What would
      the staff do? Perrin sat in his armchair by his smoldering fire and
      thought about them all. Birk-land with his superior sarcasm, Comber with
      his bullying patronage, West the vulgarian, the puppy Traill; now they
      would see that there was someone who could do more talking; now they would
      find that they owed their deliverance to someone whom they had hitherto
      despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was elated; he was triumphant. He saw himself in the midst of that
      hall, standing before them all, denouncing that iniquity....
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon drew to evening. Many voices had sounded below his window,
      but the summer evening was now drawing, softly and quietly, about the
      world. Voices came like notes of music at long intervals across the
      darkening lawns. It was nearly seven o'clock and presently it would
      be time for chapel. The staff always gathered in the Senior common room
      before chapel and they would all be there now. As he paced his room Mr.
      Perrin saw them gathered there, talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt an eager impatience to know what they were saying. Of course they
      would be talking about him, discussing it all. His impatience grew. He
      felt that he could not go into chapel until he had heard what they had to
      say. He saw them turn as he entered the room, their sudden silence, and
      then their eager coming forward. They would tell him their plans; perhaps
      they had already prepared a written protest supporting his own outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must go. He hurriedly put on his gown and hastened with shining eyes
      and a beating heart to the Upper School.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard, before he opened the door, the buzz of voices, and he entered
      the room proudly. They were all gathered about the fire&mdash;all of them,
      he thought, except Traill. Birkland was in the middle of them and they
      seemed to be all talking at once, West's voice above the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but of course he 's dotty. It's been coming on for
      years.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And the other voices came together:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they ought to have kept him out of the place. It's a
      disgrace, a thing like that happening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moy-Thompson's face! I wouldn't have missed it for all
      the holidays in the world!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but really someone ought to have stopped him. He seemed to have
      got started before anyone saw him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Spalding thought bombs were being flung about by the look of
      him.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Perrin was too greatly elated to pay very much attention to these
      speeches. He had heard nothing. He advanced up the long room with a smile
      and his head held high, his gown swinging behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had heard the door open and now they stood almost in a line, by the
      fire, watching him come up the room. They were quite silent and made no
      movement. They watched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was stopped in his advance, suddenly, by their faces. They were
      watching him, he thought, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      His confidence began to leave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nearly chapel time,&rdquo; he said uneasily. &ldquo;Hum!
      ha!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Birkland, I 've put your words into deeds, haven't
      I? Yes, indeed, hum, ha. I thought it an admirable opportunity.&rdquo; He
      stopped again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Birkland murmured something. West and Comber had turned away and were
      looking at the papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin felt that he was growing angry. It was so like them to grudge him
      any little importance that he might have obtained. They were jealous, of
      course, and wished that they had had the courage to step forward. They;
      had missed their opportunity and were indignant with him now because he
      had seized his&mdash;well!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, the color mounting to his cheeks; &ldquo;I
      flatter myself that something will come of it. It will be difficult for
      them, I think, to disregard that altogether&mdash;hum&mdash;yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was still silence and then, at last, Birkland said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to chapel to-night, Perrin?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chapel?&rdquo; sharply. &ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Again silence. Then Comber said pompously:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Perrin. Take advice from me and have a good rest. I
      should go to bed now if I were you. It 's a good holiday that you
      're wanting. Take my advice. Bed's the place&mdash;shouldn't
      go to chapel if I were you&mdash;hem.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, shouldn't go to chapel,&rdquo; repeated Dormer slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin began to breathe qnickly. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he cried.
      &ldquo;Why shouldn't I go to chapel? What do you mean about a
      holiday?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You 're tired,&rdquo; Birkland said qnickly. &ldquo;That's
      what it is. We're all tired&mdash;overdone. We've all been
      feeling it for weeks. It's a good thing term's come to an end.
      I knew something would happen. You 're tired, Perrin.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tired!&rdquo; He turned snarling upon them, his eyes flaming.
      &ldquo;Tired! It's jealousy, that's what it is! You don't
      like to see me taking the lead&mdash;you hate my coming to the front. You've
      always hated me, the lot of you. You 're jealous, that's what
      it is. You 're cruel&rdquo;&mdash;his voice suddenly broke&mdash;&ldquo;I
      was helping you all. That's why I spoke&mdash;and now&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And then with head hanging, he rushed blindly from the room.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Back to his room again, muttering, &ldquo;Jealous, that's what they
      are&mdash;beasts! Jealous! My God, they 're beasts!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He lit his lamp with trembling fingers and then on the table he saw a
      note. It was from the school-sergeant and ran thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>'.ir:</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Mr. Moy-Thompson would be greatly obliged if you could find it possible
      to step round and see him for a few minutes directly after chapel....</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      So it had come. He flung off his gown and stared at the dark frame of the
      window. The chapel bell was clanging its last notes&mdash;the boys from
      the Lower School passed under his window in a stream and their noisy
      chatter came up to him. It was a wonderful night&mdash;the dark-swelling
      trees rose in dim clouds against the silver field of stars. The bells
      stopped and very faintly he could hear the organ. He was conscious that
      his head was aching and he flung the window wide open and drank in the
      evening scents. He had passed with all the incoherent swiftness of his
      feverish brain from the insults that he had received in the Senior common
      room to his approaching interview with the headmaster. Let them rot! He
      might have known that that would be the way that they would take it&mdash;he
      was a fool to have expected anything else. His mind sped on to the future.
      He would force them all to see the kind of man that he was. He must brace
      himself up for this interview with Moy-Thompson, because this was to be
      the decisive crisis of the battle. When he had shown him how determined he
      was, when he had made it evident that he would withdraw no jot or tittle
      of his accusation, then indeed he would have the place at his feet.
      To-morrow, when they had all heard of this interview, they would sound a
      very different note.
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned out of his window, drinking in the air. He wished that he were
      cooler and that he could think more connectedly. He did not know why it
      was, but as soon as he had caught a thought and fixed it there securely,
      and had hastened after another, the first one was gone again.
    </p>
    <p>
      His thoughts were like fish in a pool. And then suddenly he thought of
      Traill&mdash;-Traill I Why was it that for weeks Traill had been his one
      thought and that now he did not count at all? There was a connection
      somewhere between all that personal quarrel and now this sudden public
      outburst. It had its link, but as he pressed his hand to his head he
      confessed that he was bewildered, that that scene in the common room had
      been a check and that he scarcely knew, in this bewilderment, what it was
      that he was going to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in his armchair with the open window behind him, although it
      was midwinter. He could hear them singing the End of Term Hymn&mdash;&ldquo;Lord,
      dismiss us with Thy Blessing&rdquo;&mdash;and singing it too with vigor
      that, exultantly, proclaimed the first happy glimpse of approaching
      freedom. He shook his shoulders with irritation and got up and closed the
      window. Then he sat down again and considered the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moy-Thompson's reception of him offered two possible alternatives.
      He could be humble or he could he arrogant&mdash;he could plead for mercy
      or he might try to bully Perrin into submission. Those were the only two
      possibilities. In the first case one would of course be as lenient as
      possible. Perrin smiled a very bitter smile as he thought of this. There
      would be things of course on which he would insist, demands that he must
      make, but he would treat Moy-Thompson gently and if certain concessions
      were made he would promise to say no more to the governors.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, if Moy-Thompson attempted to bully.... Perrin gripped
      the sides of his chair&mdash;well, he would find that he had made a
      mistake. The pale face flushed, the tired eyes glowed, the thin body
      trembled&mdash;in half an hour there would be this battle!
    </p>
    <p>
      In half an hour!&mdash;in less than half an hour! Already the opening of
      the chapel doors flung the organ in a fresh burst of sound upon the
      evening breeze. The boys once more passed the windows, shouting and
      singing. On ordinary evenings they were disciplined and quiet and passed
      into preparation in a proper state of chastened docility; but to-night was
      the last night of the term&mdash;there was to be a concert&mdash;and by
      this time to-morrow&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      They shouted as they ran into the lighted buildings and then once more
      there was silence&mdash;the organ had ceased and the chapel doors were
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin put on his gown and went out. He was stepping at last into the very
      heart of the business. He seemed to see that in reality his enemy had been
      Moy-Thompson from the beginning. That old man, with the ingenuity of the
      devil, had put young Traill in front of him and Perrin had thought that it
      was Traill that he was fighting, but now he saw, with extraordinary
      clarity, that Moy-Thompson was behind everything. That spider with that
      dark study for his web was spinning, always spinning&mdash;more
      effectively than any of them knew. In his own room with its dim light,
      surrounded by such silence, the shadows of that other room into which he
      was going frightened him against his will. He was determined that he
      would, in no way, surrender or give in, but at the back of his mind was an
      undefined suspicion that, in some fashion, Moy-Thompson would get the
      better of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished, as he went across the quadrangle, that his heart was not
      beating quite so quickly and that his brain was clearer. Moy-Thompson's
      study was dark save for the circle of light from the lamp on his table by
      the fire; the firelight leapt and danced, flinging the classical busts on
      the high shelves into a sudden derisive proximity to the white beard at
      the table, playing with the tables and chairs, dancing with flashes of
      golden light up and down the heavy, somber carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moy-Thompson was writing gravely, intently, at the table, and did not
      raise his head until he heard the click of the door. Then he put his pen
      down slowly, looked up and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mr. Perrin&mdash;do come in. I hope it wasn't
      inconvenient for you coming at this time? Sit down, won't you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin pulled himself up suddenly; his thin nervous figure showed haggard
      and worn in the firelight. What did this mean? He tried to collect his
      thoughts. No, thank you, he would rather stand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must be tired&mdash;you must indeed. Really, I insist&mdash;this
      easy-chair by the fire.&rdquo; Perrin, clutching his mortar-board between
      his hands, sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure you 'll excuse me whilst I just address this
      letter&mdash;hum, yes&mdash;only a minute.&rdquo; A silence, during which
      some heavy clock ticked solemnly in the distance: &ldquo;Of course, he
      'll wait&mdash;of course, he 'll wait&mdash;of course, he
      'll wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, Moy-Thompson swung round, away from the table and faced Perrin.
      His heard seemed to bristle with friendliness. He was very large, his
      clothes were very black, his fingers were very long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Perrin, I'm not going to keep you long&mdash;really,
      only a few moments, hum, yes. I'm sure you 're tired after a
      long day. But come, Mr. Perrin (this, leaning forward genially), we've
      got to discuss this matter, you know. Let us be friendly about it. I can
      assure you that I have nothing but the most friendly feelings towards you
      in this matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin flushed and half rose from his chair. &ldquo;No, please, Mr.
      Perrin, I beg of you&mdash;please be seated&mdash;hum&mdash;I really am
      most anxious to prove to you that I am nothing but friendly in this
      matter.&rdquo; Moy-Thompson paused and tapped his nails, with sharp little
      rattling noises, one against the other. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Perrin, I'm
      sure you must agree with me that a disturbance like that of this afternoon
      is exceedingly unusual and I may say with very considerable truth that no
      one who was present was more completely and remarkably surprised than
      myself. I do not pretend,&rdquo; he went on with a smile and lifting a
      deprecating hand towards the fire, &ldquo;that I am so pleasantly
      self-assured as to believe that there is no unsound plank in this good
      ship of ours; there are many things, I am sure, that would be the better
      for a newer and a younger hand, but I had supposed&mdash;and naturally
      supposed, I think&mdash;that any complaints that there were would be
      brought to the committee or myself privately. From time to time complaints
      <i>have</i> been brought to me and I may say that I have always dealt with
      them to the best of my ability, but&mdash;&rdquo; here Moy-Thompson
      paused, looked at Perrin, and then smiled very gently&mdash;&ldquo;do you
      know that you are the very last man whom I should have expected to have
      come to me with any complaint of any kind?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin had made no reply, had attempted to make no reply to this long
      speech. He sat in his chair without any other movement than the regular
      and rapid turning of the mortarboard between his hands. His head was bent
      towards the floor. At this last word he looked up as though he would reply
      and half started from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moy-Thompson held forward his large white hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;please, a moment&mdash;may I not explain myself? although
      it needs surely no explanations. I mean the admirable relationship that
      has always, I believe, existed between us. I must confess that if I had
      yesterday been questioned as to which of my staff I could most securely
      trust and honor I should have named yourself.&rdquo; He paused and then
      slowly added, &ldquo;I need scarcely remind you that it is only a
      fortnight since there passed between us, in this very room, an interview
      of the most friendly and confidential description.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no word from the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember that, during the many years that have passed
      since you have been with me here you have made no kind of complaint. You
      have had many, very many opportunities, for voicing things freely to me. I
      have always been frank with you&mdash;you 've seized none of them.
      All the more amazing, the more compelling my surprise then, at what
      occurred to-day.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At last there was a pause that demanded a reply. The room was filled with
      silence and neither man moved. Perrin was striving to clear his brain.
      What was he to say? What had he come to say? Where were all the things
      that he had thought out so carefully in his study? Moreover, it was true;
      it was all amazingly true. They had been friends, he and Moy-Thompson, all
      these years, great friends. Other members of the staff may have rebelled
      and quarreled and disputed, but he had always supported authority. He
      remembered now with a kind of dazed surprise the pleasure that he had
      taken in those little quarter-of-an-hour interviews in that very room.
      This momentous and horrible fact rose now before him and froze any reply
      that he might make. He had been Moy-Thompson's devoted henchman for
      twenty years&mdash;was he the right man to head a rebellion now?
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the long silence he made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Moy-Thompson, rubbing one hand against
      another, &ldquo;I see that you admit, Mr. Perrin, that there is justice in
      some of my remarks. These things are facts&mdash;that you have been twenty
      years without a complaint, and that until this afternoon you and I (here
      more rubbing of the hands) were working shoulder to shoulder at a hard
      task that demanded our friendly cooperation. Then suddenly there is this
      outbreak; an outbreak unprecedented in the annals of our school; an
      outbreak for which there is no obvious reason; an outbreak that is in its
      nature, I should imagine, extremely foreign to your own character and
      habits&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Moy-Thompson paused an instant and then suddenly,
      &ldquo;Well, what is the only explanation? What can be the only
      explanation?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Still no word from Mr. Perrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Mr. Moy-Thompson genially, &ldquo;overwork,
      of course. Overwork. We have perhaps all noticed that, during these last
      weeks, things were being a little too much for you&mdash;hum&mdash;yes&mdash;natural
      enough, natural enough. We 're all tired at times and it's a
      long time since you were out of harness&mdash;yes, indeed.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'm not tired.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, well, perhaps the onlookers, in some cases, see the most of the
      game. But you must admit that it affords an admirable and sufficient
      excuse for to-day's little episode&mdash;the only excuse indeed
      (this a little more sharply)&mdash;but an excuse that we all of us&mdash;I
      speak for others as well as myself&mdash;are only too ready to seize. A
      holiday, my friend, a holiday&mdash;there we have our doctor's
      medicine.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the waters of misery that were closing about him the man raised his
      head. Of all the many things that had come upon him this was the worst. He
      faced it with despair&mdash;he knew as he heard the other man's
      words pour along like a river that he had nothing to say. How could he
      make a fine rebel when the day before yesterday he had been assisting and
      abetting? How could he make a fine rebel when they all thought that he was
      merely overdone? How could he make a fine rebel when instead of the terror
      that he thought that he had brought he found only a gentle contempt and
      the opinion that he was tired and needed a holiday?
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere, in the back attics of his brain, something was telling him that
      this was not quite so simple as it appeared&mdash;that this old man in his
      dark room was playing as elaborate a game as did ever Philip II in the
      dark recesses of his palace at Madrid. And he saw, \ although his head was
      buzzing, that there was, in that plan, good wisdom of a kind. To have
      Perrin back again, in the chains of the old familiar authority, was to
      have Perrin silenced, humbled&mdash;finally quieted. But how was he to
      battle with these things? They were too clever for him; he knew that the
      accumulated years of tradition behind him, the heaping together of those
      many, many times when he had knocked on that study door, the solemn
      consciousness of the obsequious attentions that he had so often paid to
      that white beard, these things rose and defeated him&mdash;defeated him on
      the last occasion that the chances of battle were to be offered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he tried to say something.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in a tired, passionless voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had reason,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;for what I did. I meant
      what I said and I mean it now. You have made this place hateful to all of
      us and I want to hand in my resignation now. I had hoped that what I did
      this afternoon might have brought matters to a head, might have helped us
      all to act together as a body. But they 're jealous of me&mdash;if
      anyone else had done it&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      His head dropped&mdash;his voice ceased. Then he repeated, drearily,
      &ldquo;I want to hand in my resignation.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock ticked on solemnly. At last Moy-Thompson spoke, very gently and
      a little sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry, extremely sorry, if, after all these years you feel
      that I have acted unjustly towards you, but I hope that you will not think
      me unfriendly&mdash;my last wish is to appear in any way unfriendly&mdash;if
      I say that this opinion of yours&mdash;a little hurriedly assumed, perhaps&mdash;owes
      something to the mental fatigue to which I have already alluded. All I beg
      of you is to wait before you hand in your resignation, to wait until you
      are stronger both in mind and body. I think I may say that the governors
      will only too readily allow you a holiday during next term&mdash;when the
      summertime is with us you will return alert and fresh in body and mind.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Tick&mdash;tick&mdash;tick went the clock&mdash;&ldquo;Here's a good
      offer&mdash;Here's a good offer.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish to hand in my resignation,&rdquo; said Mr. Perrin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course if you will, you will. I can only say that we shall all
      be genuinely sorry. Let me, at any rate, implore you to wait before making
      your decision. In a few weeks' time perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant every word that I said this afternoon. This place is
      scandalous&mdash;scandalous&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I regret that you feel that. I'm extremely sorry that you
      feel about it as you do. But at least let me beg you to wait for a few
      weeks. Write to me. Write to the governors&mdash;write to anyone you
      please. But wait&mdash;let me urge you to wait.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Moy-Thompson's hand was laid upon Perrin's knee. Again
      there was silence. Then at last:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. What does it matter? I will wait. I haven't the
      strength to break with anything. I'm no use&mdash;no good.&rdquo; He
      got to his feet and then suddenly broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you, I'm right. You 're too clever for me,
      but I'm right. What I've said is true, it's all true.
      You 're a devil. You've had us all at your mercy for years and
      years. You've worked us against one another until you've
      rubbed all our courage and finer pieces off us and you 're pleased&mdash;you
      're pleased. You've had a fine life of it&mdash;you, a God's
      parson&mdash;and you've made money and you've broken hearts
      and you've eaten and drunk&mdash;and you 're too clever for
      us, but there's hell for you somewhere. I see it and I know it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke away and burst stumbling from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be that for once the man whom he left heard the sound of some
      judgment in his ears, for he stood, long after every stir in the world
      about him had passed away, staring, without movement and afraid.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      But Perrin had no exultation in him; it was not of Moy-Thompson he was
      thinking. The last stones of his fortress had been removed from his
      defenses and he stood utterly naked to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not attempt now to gather his resources about him. He cared no more
      for any face that he might present to the world. He had reached the heart
      of his kingdom and he saw that he was no good&mdash;no good at all&mdash;an
      utterly useless man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not even the pluck to defy Moy-Thompson, to fling his resignation
      in his face. He was no good.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very cold when he reached his room, and as he pushed back the door
      he saw Traill. Traill was standing in the middle of the room, looking very
      shy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin was not glad or sorry to see him. He had no feeling about him at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you sit down?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. I only came in for a moment.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, all right. What is it?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Only I wanted to tell you&mdash;that&mdash;well&mdash;oh, that
      I thought you were awfully plucky this afternoon.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Thank you. It wasn't plucky really&mdash;it was a very
      foolish thing to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;really&mdash;the other fellows did n't understand&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes! They understood very well.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Traill paused. He obviously hated the whole affair but was determined to
      go through with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I say, I'm leaving to-morrow, you know&mdash;not coming
      back&mdash;and I thought that it would be a pity if we parted&mdash;well,
      sick with each other. What do you say? We've had one or two
      turn-ups, but we 're friends, are n't we?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shake hands, will you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are. Look Isabel and me up in town one day, won't
      you? Always awfully pleased. Well, I must be going.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with a sigh of relief, Traill moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what did the boy know, what could the boy know, of the man's
      utter despair as he sat there through the night? Traill went out to his
      life. &ldquo;He had made it up with the chap,&rdquo; but Perrin, in the
      dark, was looking, with staring eyes, at Himself. At last, that gray
      figure that had haunted him so closely during these weeks was with him
      face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, with the coming dawn, he knew what it was that he would do.

      CHAPTER XV&mdash;THE GOLDEN VIEW

    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ITH the coming
      dawn he knew what it was that he would do. He waited, sitting in his chair
      without moving and watching, with unseeing eyes, the gray cold pane of his
      window and the last faint glow of the sinking coals that lingered in the
      grate. He did not know what he could have said to Moy-Thompson, what he
      ought to have said. He thought that he might have faced it out better had
      the interview been in some other place. There were so many things that
      hung about that room and made it impossible for him to speak. He had not
      known that it would be so hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not care, he really did not care. He saw vaguely that all these
      many years the growing suspicion that he was really no good had been
      coming upon him but he had never confessed it&mdash;now it stared him in
      the face. If he had been any good he would have defied Moy-Thompson. He
      knew that he had not the courage, at his time in life, to go out and face
      the world again and get some other work to do. Also he had not the courage
      to come back another term and go on with the work here. He had not even
      had the pluck to hate Traill properly, as any other man would do.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he did not feel that it was all his fault. He was a pleasant
      enough man if only someone had tried to like him&mdash;and then these
      headaches&mdash;and then those days when his brain was so strangely
      confused&mdash;no, it was not entirely his fault. And, last of all, if
      Isabel Desart.&mdash;-Well, why think about it? They all mocked him&mdash;even
      Moy-Thompson did not think him important enough to be angry with. He was
      very sick and tired of life.
    </p>
    <h3>
      II.
    </h3>
    <p>
      The dawn came late in those winter mornings but the house was very silent
      as the heavy black behind the window lifted to a lighter gray. Some clock
      downstairs chimed and Perrin raised his eyes from the black cold grate and
      saw that soon it would be sunrise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The things in his room were ghostly shapes, but he knew where everything
      was and he moved about, himself the greatest ghost of all, making
      everything tidy. He put the books back into their places, he tore up the
      pile of papers on the table, he laid a note that he had written on the
      middle of the cloth where it could easily be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he stood for a moment and looked at it all in silence, then with a
      little sigh he took his greatcoat from the back of the door where it was
      hanging, put it on and went out. He passed very softly through the
      solemnly-dark corridors, down the cold stone stairs, and along the dark
      hall that presented such odd shapes and figures to him in the half-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung back the bolts and bars of the hall-door and stepped out into the
      mysterious garden. He drew a deep breath at the sweetness of it; its
      beauty crowded upon him as though with eager fingers, taking hold of him,
      almost as though it were pleading with him to stay and take pause before
      he made any decision. It was an ordinary enough garden in the daytime, but
      now was the most strangely moving moment in all the cycle of the hours
      when the sun had sent word of his gorgeous coming and when the brown earth
      and the seeds and roots held by it stirred to share in the pageant. The
      breeze in Perrin's face was pure with all the freshness of the first
      moments of the day and all about him he seemed to hear the movement and
      stirring of countless things. Afterwards in the cold winter day bare
      branches would rattle against the hard light of the frozen sun&mdash;now
      everything was wrapt in curtains of silver mist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the garden and went down the Brown Hill towards the sea. In front
      of him a great sheet of sky was slowly catching light into the threads and
      fibers of it. From its foundations where the dark band of the land hid it
      great fountains of color were held behind the cloud and the suggestion of
      their richness was passing already into the thickly-curtained gray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin turned aside towards the bottom of the hill and struck off
      across a frozen field into a bare and leafless wood. The light was growing
      with every moment, the bare outlines of the country stood out sharp and
      black against the surrounding gray and the great bank of cloud was slowly
      filling with golden light. The wood was very still; through the heart of
      it a little avenue of trees ran&mdash;now they were gaunt and stiff in two
      lines with the road cold and gray between. At the end of the little avenue
      there is suddenly a break, a sharp cliff running sharply to the white road
      beneath, and then below the road again there is the sea. It is a wonderful
      view from here, for the sea curves like a silver bowl into infinite
      distance. Through the country-side it is known as &ldquo;The Golden View,&rdquo;
      not golden now, however, but mysteriously moving and heaving beneath its
      gray veil with the faintest threads of color beginning to interlace the
      fabric of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin stood, a curiously tiny figure, at the end of the avenue and
      looked at the gray cliff at his feet. Behind him was the dark wood; in
      front of him a vast and swiftly-changing world. Very soon, as the sun rose
      above the sea, the world would be, once again, undisturbed. &ldquo;To
      fling oneself down on to that cold white road&rdquo; was a very easy death
      to die, but even now as he faced it he wondered whether he had the
      courage. He shivered in the cold and drew his coat closer about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought that he would walk about a little. He turned round and saw
      coming towards him, through the leafless trees, Isabel Desart.
    </p>
    <h3>
      III.
    </h3>
    <p>
      He did not know what to do or say; at the first sight of her he thought
      that his eyes had deceived him and, because at this supreme moment of his
      life he was thinking of her, he had imagined that he saw her. She was
      dressed also in gray, with a gray cloak and a little round gray hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then in the hearty ring of her voice he knew that it was no ghost.
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said faintly, taking a step towards her, and his
      voice was full of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Perrin,&rdquo; she said very easily; &ldquo;I
      could not sleep and I had thought that I would come down here to see the
      sun rise&mdash;and then I saw you pass through the school gates and I was
      impertinent enough to follow you. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To talk to me?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed suddenly that he was cold and that his teeth were chattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Let us walk on to Rayner's Point. We ought to get there
      just as the sun rises.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her as she turned down the path. His mind had been so full of
      what he had intended to do that he felt that she must have known. He
      glanced at her almost guiltily as he followed her. How beautiful she was!
      He pulled his coat closer about his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you didn't very much want to be alone,&rdquo; she said
      smiling at him; &ldquo;but really, I couldn't miss my opportunity. I
      have been wanting&mdash;very badly&mdash;ever since yesterday afternoon&mdash;to
      speak to you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; he repeated bitterly. &ldquo;You
      must feel as they all do, about that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how the others feel,&rdquo; she answered almost
      fiercely. &ldquo;That is no business of mine. But I understood, I
      sympathized, a great deal more than you would believe&mdash;and I wanted
      to tell you so.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You couldn't understand&mdash;you couldn't sympathize.
      It doesn't touch you anywhere. You 're going to-day and you
      won't come back. Well, don't think of any of us again. Don't
      try and help us&mdash;it only makes it worse for us.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, please; that is unkind and untrue. If you would let me I would
      understand&mdash;and even if I am going away it would be something for
      both of us if we knew that we had parted friends, that&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly he interrupted her, standing in her path, his face working
      most strangely, muttering words that she could not catch. She wondered
      what he was going to do, he looked so odd and wild against the breaking
      dawn. Then he seemed to turn from her with a gesture that had some strange
      greatness in it; he faced the sea, his hands clenched behind his back and
      in the still hush of the morning she heard his sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please&mdash;don't,&rdquo; and then she stayed in
      infinite distress waiting for him to turn. His figure was so desolate, so
      thin and ragged, in the cold morning air, and her heart was full of the
      deepest aching pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he turned round to her. &ldquo;Let us go on,&rdquo; he said
      roughly; &ldquo;I am all in pieces&mdash;don't mind me&mdash;you
      shouldn't have spoken to me like that&mdash;it's more than I
      can stand.&rdquo; Then after a pause he went on, &ldquo;You mustn't
      talk of our being friends. A man like myself cannot be a friend of yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is for me to say,&rdquo; she answered gently. &ldquo;I have
      been so wrong all this term. I have only made things worse instead of
      better and I did so want to help. It's been awful this term and
      yesterday afternoon was the worst of all. Oh! If you only knew how I had
      agreed with the things you said!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is n't any use,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It's too
      late.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't too late. It's never too late. If you won't
      let me help you, why then perhaps you 'll help me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help you?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;if you knew how miserable it will always make me if we
      part like this&mdash;I shall never cease my regret. Please, tell me a
      little of what you've felt, of what you 're going to do. It
      isn't kind to me to leave it like this.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. She had never before realized how young she was;
      her inexperience faced her most desperately, so that she felt bitterly
      that she could not touch even the fringe of his troubles. Every word that
      she uttered seemed an impertinence and yet she knew that if she went away
      without speaking she would regret it all her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he turned round to her; he seemed to have gained absolute control
      of himself and his voice was quite steady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I hadn't meant to be rude like that&mdash;only you
      took me by surprise. I've made a wretched muddle of things and,
      since yesterday afternoon, I 've seen that I'm a complete
      failure in every possible sense of the word. You are so splendid in all
      ways&mdash;and you are going to have such a splendid life&mdash;that we
      are at the opposite ends of the world, you and I.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She noticed, whilst he was speaking, that his speech was clear of all its
      little affectations and pomposities. He seemed another man from the
      strange creature whom she had known before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we are not at the opposite ends of the world. I have felt so
      miserable all this term. I have felt that in some way I ought to have made
      things better between you and Archie&mdash;Mr. Traill&mdash;all that
      wretched quarreling&mdash;and yet I felt so helpless.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. That would have been inevitable without you. An older man
      feeling that he was being jockeyed out of his place by a younger man and
      the younger man resenting the older man's interference&mdash;and
      neither Traill nor I were, I suppose, very tactful. And there we were
      pressed up against one another with the whole place working on our nerves.
      No, you had n't very much to do with it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But it showed how young she was that she did not see the half-tender,
      half-ironical look that he flung upon her. In his heart he was wondering
      whether he would tell her, but something, perhaps her very absence of all
      self-consciousness, held him back&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on, softly, almost as though he were talking to himself. &ldquo;And
      then, these last weeks it all got on my nerves to such an extent that I
      was nearly off my head. I wanted to kill Traill. I might have killed him
      if I had been a stronger man. I felt that it was all so unfair that he
      should have everything&mdash;youth, health, prospects, popularity&mdash;everything&mdash;and
      I nothing. I had never been a likable man, perhaps, but there seemed to be
      no reason. I had it in me, I thought, to do things&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped for a moment and looked at the sea; its gray was being shot
      with blue and gold and the banks of mist on the horizon were rolling back
      like gates before the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;And then, yesterday afternoon, when Moy-Thompson was making
      his speech, I seemed to see suddenly that it was the place&mdash;the
      system&mdash;that I had been up against all this time, and not any one
      person&mdash;and suddenly I burst out, scarcely knowing, you know&mdash;and
      I thought I'd done rather a big thing. I thought the other men would
      be glad that I had led the way. I thought Moy-Thompson would be furious
      and frightened, but the other men were amused and Moy-Thompson laughed&mdash;and
      suddenly everything cleared and I saw what this place had made of me. They
      say that it takes a man all a lifetime to know himself&mdash;well, I
      've got that knowledge early. I know what I am.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      She suddenly put out her hand and he caught it fiercely in his. &ldquo;You
      're going to have a fine life,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there are so
      many people that you will do good to&mdash;but you have been everything to
      one useless creature.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall always be proud to be your friend.&rdquo; Curiously, in the
      growing light, with that strange, uncouth figure holding her hand, she
      felt more strongly moved than she had ever been before&mdash;yes, even
      Archie Traill's wooing had not touched her as this did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm too young to know all that it has meant to you,&rdquo; at
      last she said brokenly, &ldquo;but I shall never, all my life through,
      forget you. I shall want, please, always to hear&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To hear?&rdquo; His lips twisted into a strange smile. &ldquo;Ah,
      you must n 't want that.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not? What are you going to do&mdash;now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To do?&rdquo; He was still strangely smiling. &ldquo;What is there
      for me to do? I am too old to struggle outside for a living. I have no
      means and I am fit for nothing but schoolmastering&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot you come back here&mdash;in spite of it all?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Moy-Thompson wants me to come back. He thinks that I am so
      unimportant that&mdash;it does n't matter.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will&mdash;promise that you will!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, it is all so useless,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head. &ldquo;Before,
      when I had built up a kind of opinion of myself it was hard enough, but
      now, when that is all gone&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I wonder if I can make you understand&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes
      were flaming&mdash;&ldquo;you <i>must</i>&mdash;you <i>must</i>. Don't
      you see that you 're being given such a chance! Think of the pluck
      of it&mdash;after all that has happened&mdash;to come back, knowing what
      they think of you, knowing what you think of yourself. Oh! I envy you. I
      believe the only thing we 're in the world for is to have courage&mdash;that
      answers everything&mdash;and some of us have such fat, easy lives that we've
      no chance at all. But you to come back with your teeth set, to build it
      all up again, to will it all back! Oh! it's splendid! And Archie and
      I will have our happy, ordinary existences&mdash;just going along&mdash;and
      you 'll be here doing the finest thing in the world. I'd
      change places with you to-morrow,&rdquo; she magnificently ended up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see it like that?&rdquo; he said slowly almost to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I see it like that. Why, I believe that's what all
      this term's been for&mdash;to bring to a head&mdash;to show you your
      great chance. That 's life&mdash;everything leading up to the one
      big thing&mdash;and now this is yours.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;If I could!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I believe in you&mdash;come
      back&mdash;fight it&mdash;win.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But he shook his head very slowly, very sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I'm not the kind of man to do a thing like that. I
      've had my spirit broken&mdash;this place has broken it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is not. I know it is not. Here's your chance&mdash;take
      it.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All these years,&rdquo; he answered grimly, &ldquo;twenty years&mdash;it's
      a long time for a man. I can't begin all over again.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twenty years are nothing. You 've never seen things straight
      as you see things now&mdash;It 's never been the same before.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned round and stared fiercely into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you believe I could do it?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Win back respect&mdash;make them forget yesterday&mdash;go on with
      the old torture&mdash;&rdquo; he shuddered and buried his face in his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in you,&rdquo; she answered steadfastly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew a deep breath. &ldquo;At last!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe in you.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not saying that only to comfort met&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; you know that I am not.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To come back&mdash;to go on&mdash;to face it all.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the hardest thing and the finest thing&mdash;I shall
      know&mdash;I shall always remember.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      As he looked at her he knew that he might kiss her and that she would not
      have drawn back&mdash;but she was not his. He faced it out in that brief
      moment&mdash;all the ignominy, the mockery, the drudgery&mdash;the hell
      that Moffatt's was. Was it really his chance? Was he really in some
      way a new man, or was it only the passing emotion that moved him? Could he
      do anything still with his poor old wreck of a soul?
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence. They had reached Rayner's Point. Here the
      sea swept, in a great arc to left and right. Sea and sky were very faintly
      blue. The sun broke the golden bands that bound it, the light flooded the
      brown earth of the winter fields, the shining mist glittered through the
      brown wood that hung like a cloud behind them on the horizon, a white
      gull, breaking the stillness with its cries, swerved past them out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perrin drew a deep breath. &ldquo;If you will help me, I 'll come
      back,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new day shone about their heads.
    </p>
    <h3>
      IV.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Later, at the Comber's breakfast-table there was confusion. Mrs.
      Comber was flushed and happy. It was true that this happy release was only
      for a few weeks, but her &ldquo;Freddie&rdquo; was more genial and
      pleasant than he had been since the days of their honeymoon and her boys
      were returning that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Freddie&mdash;another sausage&mdash;Oh! My dear Isabel, here's
      a bill from that dressmaker again and she sent one only last week; she can't
      leave one alone. Really, Freddie, another one won't hurt you&mdash;and
      I told her only a month ago that I couldn't pay for that black silk
      until Easter&mdash;well, some marmalade, then, if you won't have
      another&mdash;what train did you say you were going to catch, Isabel? I'm
      so glad it's a sunny day&mdash;you were up quite early weren't
      you, dear?&mdash;and I meant to go in and see what Mrs. Dormer had to say
      about yesterday afternoon, you know, Mr. Perrin&mdash;and now I shan't
      have a minute because Jane's been so silly about Freddie's
      shirts and his pyjamas&mdash;she missed them when they came from the wash,
      so that really it&mdash;but what did you think of it all, Isabel dear?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what all?&rdquo; asked Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mr. Perrin, of course. Poor man, of course he's been
      queer all this time&mdash;anyone could see, but really&mdash;I wonder what
      he 'll do now?&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect that he 'll come back,&rdquo; said Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back? Well! But of course Moy-Thompson will have him back if
      he can. That would keep him quiet. Then he could pretend to the governors
      that it was simply nerves&mdash;which it was mostly, I should think. I'm
      sure we were all nervy enough for anything. I'm sure I've been
      most queer all this term. And then his quarreling like that with Archie
      and everything. Oh! Yes, Moy-Thompson will keep him if he can&mdash;under
      his thumb.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Freddie Comber had left the room. The two women were alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber was sitting at the table, with her mouth wide open, like a
      fish, counting on the cloth with her fingers in order to remember the
      things that she ought to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear?&rdquo; said Isabel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mrs. Comber, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to do something for me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything in the world, dear, you know. Five, Mrs. Johnson's
      hill for that ironing; six, Freddie's socks; seven, the suit&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear, please&mdash;just for a minute I want you to listen
      altogether to me.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo; Mrs. Comber stopped her counting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's this. Mr. Perrin <i>is</i> coming back. I saw him
      this morning&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You saw him this morning! Isabel!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. We both went out to see the sun rise&mdash;to the Golden View.
      He talked to me. Dear, I never understood things before&mdash;things or
      people. There must be so many people like that who are so splendid inside
      and so dull outside.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to be unkind, dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Comber answered
      slowly, &ldquo;but I cannot believe that Mr. Perrin is splendid inside&mdash;I
      can't really.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but he is, he is! He's coming back like a hero. Why, when
      I think of Archie and myself and our lives&mdash;and all the other people
      with lives like them&mdash;and then when I think of all the awkward,
      bad-mannered, stiff, jolty people who are heroes every day they live, I'm
      ashamed!&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Comber was astonished. &ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it
      does seem to have affected you&mdash;really. Of course I want to be kind
      to everybody&mdash;even Mrs. Dormer&mdash;and of course I 'll
      believe what you say, and I'm sure I'm very sorry for him, and
      it won't be pleasant for him coming back.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Isabel. &ldquo;It won't&mdash;no one ought
      ever to come back here again&mdash;but if only you 'll be a friend
      to him&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she went on again, &ldquo;he's the kind of
      man whom those things matter to so frightfully. And no one's ever
      taken any interest in him or any trouble&mdash;and now if you and I&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything,&rdquo; said Mrs. Comber, &ldquo;that you want me to do.&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes think,&rdquo; said Isabel, &ldquo;that the world's
      topsy-turvy. People seem to put so much value on all the outside things,
      and if someone's ugly and awkward&mdash;&rdquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Her gaze through the window was arrested by the sight of a cab at the door
      of the Lower School. The porter came out with a brown portmanteau&mdash;a
      very old brown portmanteau&mdash;and he put it on the cab. It was a very
      old cab, and a very old horse and a very old driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Perrin, wearing a bowler that was too small for him and in his old
      shabby overcoat, got into the cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bag bounced about on the roof as the old horse stumbled away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he come back and fight it out? She knew, with certain faith, that he
      would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he win through? She did not know, but in the sun and glorious beauty
      of that day she seemed to get her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the old cab rumbled down the Brown Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>shall</i> be all right, next term,&rdquo; said Mr. Perrin.
    </p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
